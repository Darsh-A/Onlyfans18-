- Totality of an organism's chemical reaction is called metabolism.
- it is an emergent property of life that arises from orderly interactions between molecules.

# First law of Thermodynamics

Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created nor destroyed.

# Second law of Thermodynamics

Every energy transformation increases the entropy of the universe.

## Metabolic pathways



 



- In a metabolic pathway, a specific molecule is altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a certain product.
- Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme which speeds up a chemical reaction.
- The mechanisms that regulate these enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand.

- It manages the material and energy resources of the cell.
- Some release energy by breaking down(**catabolic pathways**) complex molecules.
```
One major catabolic pathway is cellular respiration, which breaks down glucose and other organic fuels in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. 
```

- Some consume energy to build complicated molecules from simplier ones called **anabolic pathways** or **Biosynthetic pathways**
