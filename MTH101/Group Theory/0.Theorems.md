## Groups

[Theorem 1.1 - Definition of Identity](<1.Groups#More on Identity Element:#Uniqueness of Identity>) [& its Uniqueness](<#1.Groups#More on Identity Element:>)
Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$ such that $f x = x$ for some $x$ in $G$.
Then, $f = 1_{G}$

[Theorem 1.2 - Definition of Inverses](<1.Groups#Inverses:#Uniqueness of Inverses:>) [& its Uniqueness](<1.Groups#Inverses:>)
Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$.
If $h$ is an element such that $fh = 1_{G}$, then $h = f^{-1}$.
Similarly,
	if $h$ satisfies $hf = 1_{G}$, then
	$h = f^{-1}$.

## Symmetry

[Theorem 2.1](<2.Symmetry#Important Observation:#Compositions with Algebra>)
$$
\varphi \gamma ^{i} = \gamma ^{-i} \varphi
$$

-----------------------------------
## Isomorphism

[Theorem 3.1](<3.Isomorphism#Theorem-1>)

***Note:*** Isomorphism preseves identity and inverses
	If $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism. Then,
		1. $\phi(1_{G}) = 1_{H}$	
		2. For any $x \in G$ , $\phi(x^{-1}) = \phi(x)^{-1}$


[Theorem 3.2](<3.Isomorphism#Theorem 2>)
***Note:*** Groups are isomorhphic to one another
	Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. Let $\phi:G \rightarrow H$ be a group isomorphism.
	Then, the function $\phi ^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is also a group isomorphism


-----------------------------

## Sub-Groups

[Theorem 4.1](<4.Sub-Groups.md#A Test for Subgroups#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a group. Let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$.
	Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ $\iff$ for any $x,y$ in $H$ it also contains the element $xy^{-1}$

[Theorem 4.2](<4.Sub-Groups#Order of a Group:#Finite Groups:#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a finite group. Then, for any element $x$ of $G$, there exists a positive integer $d \leq |G|$ such that $x^{d} = 1$


---------------------


[Theorem 5.1](<5.Lagrange's Theorem.md#Theorem>)
	Let $G$ be a [finite group.](Sub-Groups.md#Order%20of%20a%20Group#Finite%20Groups of a Group#Finite Groups>) Then , for any $x \in G$, 
	$ord(x) \leq |G|$

------------------------------------

## 8.Subset of Subgroups

[Theorem 8.1](8.Subset%20of%20Subgroups.md#Theorem Groups#Theorem>)
Let $G$ be a group. Let $S$ be a set of subgroups of $G$. Then, the intersection of all subgroups in $S$ is a subgroup of $G$

[Theorem 8.2](<8.Cyclic Groups#Subgroup generated by a Set#What does $<S>$ look like#Statement:>)
Let $M$ be the set of all the elements of $G$ which can be written in the form
$x_{1}^{m_{1}} ,x_{2}^{m_{2}} \dots x_{r}^{m_{r}}$ 
where,
	- $r$ is a positive integer
	- $x_{1},x_{2}\dots x_{r} \in S$
Then, $M$ is a subgroup of $G$

[Theorem 8.3](8.Subset%20of%20Subgroups.md#Abelian%20Groups#Theorem Groups#Abelian Groups#Theorem>)
Let $(G, +)$ be an abelian group. Let $S \subseteq G$. Then $<S>$ is equal to the set of all elements of the form $n_{1}x_{1}+n_{2}x_{2}+\dots +n_{r}x_{r}$  
where  $x_{1}\dots x_{r} \in G$ and  $n_{1}\dots n_{r} \in \mathbb{Z}$

## 9.Cyclic Groups

[Theorem 9.1](<9.Cyclic Groups.md#Structure of Cyclic Groups#Case 2: $ord(a)$ is finite#Theorem:>)
Suppose $a^{n}=1$ for some integer $n$ and $ord(a)=m$ . Then, $m \: | \: n$

[Theorem 9.2](<9.Cyclic Group#Order of an element of $G = \: <a>$>#Theorem-2>)
Suppose $G = \langle a \rangle$ and $ord(a)=m$ , where $m \in \mathbb{Z}$
Then, $ord(a^{k}) = \frac{m}{gcd(k)}$ , for any integer $k$
