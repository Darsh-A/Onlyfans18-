To efficiently solve repetitive human day-to-day problems, we can break down the process and have a computer do it for us.

#### Computer-based solving process:
- Analyze the problem to define its principal components with their core functionalities (input/output).
- Develop an algorithm to go from input to output.
- Convert the written algorithm into a program using a programming language (this is coding).
- Test and debug the program before deployment of software.


### Algorithm
- It is defined as a sequence of rules/instructions to be followed in solving a program.
- An algorithm has clearly defined steps along with their sequence.

##### Characteristics of a good algorithm:
- Well defined input(s) and output(s).
- Steps should be unambiguous and precise.
- Each step results are uniquely defined according to the preceding inputs.
- The algorithm should stop after a finite number of steps.
- It must be plain and simple instructions which can be implemented in any programming language.


#### Representation of an algorithm
An algorithm can be written in either **Flowchart** or **Psuedocode**. This shows the logic of the code with the details to implement the code.
