# Evolution of Cell Signaling ##

-Signaling mechanisms first evolved in ancient prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes.
#### Quorum sensing####
*Sensing the concentration of such signaling molecules allows bacteria to monitor their own local cell density. It helps the bacterial populations to coordinate the behaviour of all cells in a population in activities that require a given density of cell acting at the same time*
$$Example$$
*Biofilm, an aggregation of bacterial cells attached to the surface by molecules secreted by the cells, but only after the cells have  reached a certain density
- *It protects the cells in it and derive nutrition from he surface they are on*
- *Believed to be involved in up to 80% of all human bacterial infections*
- *Slimy coating on a fallen log or on leaves lying on a forest path*
- *Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae—which are used to make bread, wine, and beer— identify their sexual mates by chemical signaling when they reproduce sexually.*![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 3.18.45 PM.png]]
### Signal Transduction Pathway

Binding of a mating factor by the yeast cell-surface receptor initiate a signal that brings about the cellular response of mating takes place in a series of three major steps-
==_-Signal Reception
-Signal Transduction
-Cellular response

# Local and Long-Distance Signaling

- Eukaryotic cells may communicate by direct contact, which is one type of local signaling.
- Many animal and plant cells have cell junctions that directly connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells( signaling substances dissolved in the cytosol can pass between neighbouring cells). 
- Some animal may communicate by direct contact between cell surface molecules.
*---important in embroynic development, immune response, and in maintaining adult stem cell populations*
- Some molecules travel short distances, influences cells that are nearby. This type of local signals is called $paracrine  signaling$
- $Growth factors$ regulators consists of compounds that stimulate nearby target cells to grow and divide.
- $Synaptic signaling$ is a highly specialised type of local signaling in the animal nervous system.
*----An electrical signal alomg a nerve cell triggers the secretion of neurotransmitter molecules. These molecules act as chemical signals, diffusing across the synapse— the narrow space between the nerve cell and its target cell—triggering a response in the target cell.*
- Both animals and plants use molecules called hormones for long-distance signaling.
- $Endocrine signaling$  is hormonal signaling in animals.

### THREE STAGES OF CELL SIGNALING:-

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>![[Pasted image 20221228172852.png]] ***Earl W. Sutherlan(Nobel Prize in 1971)

*He and his colleagues investigated how the animal hormone epinephrine triggers the "fight-or-fight" response in animals like the impala.*

- Effect of epinephrine is to mobilize fuel reserves, which can be used by the animals to either defend itself or try to escape.
- Epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of the storage polysaccharide glycogen within liver cells and skeletal muscle cells.
- Breakdown of glycogen releases the sugar glucose 1-phosphate, which the cell converts to glucose 6-phosphate.
- Glycogen phosphorylase could be activated by epinephrine only when the hormone was added to intact cells. This led to two conclusions:-
--***``
```First, epinephrine does not interact directly with the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown; an intermediate step or series of steps must be occurring in the cell. Second, an intact, membrane-bound cell must be present for transmission of the signal to take place.```

==SIGNAL RECEPTION

- signaling molecule acts as a ligand, the term for a molecule that specifically binds to another (often larger) molecule.
- Ligand binding generally causes a receptor protein to undergo a change in shape.
- Most signal receptors are plasma membrane proteins.

# *Receptors in the Plasma Membrane* 

Largest family of human cell-surface receptors is that of *$$G protein-coupled receptors$$  G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that are used by cells to convert extracellular signals into intracellular responses, including responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, as well as responses to vision, olfaction and taste signals. There are more than 800 GPCRs.

- Cell-surface transmembrane receptors work by looking at three major types:
**-G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
-Receptor tyrosine kinases
-Ion channel receptors.

###### Cell surface receptors (half of which are GPCRs) represent 30% of all human proteins, determining their structures by X-ray crystallography
***
##### G Protein-coupled Receptors                     

- It is a cell-surface transmembrane receptor that works with the help of a G protein, a protein that binds the energy-rich molecule GTP.  
![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 8.35.40 PM.png]]
- GPCR proteins are all remarkably similar in structure.
- They make up a large family of eukaryotic receptor proteins with a secondary structure in which the single polypeptide.
###### Similarities in the structures of G proteins and GPCRs in diverse organisms tells that G proteins and their associated receptors evolved very early among eukaryotes.
- Bacteria that cause cholera, pertussis (whooping cough), and botulism, among others, make their victims ill by producing toxins that interfere with G protein function.
- *60%* of all medicines used today exert their effects by influencing  
G protein pathways.
###### -GPCRs generally activate a single transduction pathway.
***
##### Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

###### RTK(**Receptor tyrosine kinases**) is a protein kinase
-An enzyme that catalyses the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to another protein.
- The part of the receptor protein extending in the cytoplasm functions more specifically as a tyrosine kinase.
![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 5.34.14 PM.png]]

- Upon binding a ligand such as a growth factor, one RTK may activate ten or more different transduction pathways and cell- ular responses.

***`` Ability of a single ligand-binding event to trigger so many pathways is a key difference between RTKs and GPCR

- Abnormal RTKs that function even in the absence of signaling molecules are associated with many kinds of cancer.

***``The binding of a signaling molecule (such as a growth factor) causes two receptor monomers to associate closely with each other, forming a complex known as a dimer, a process called dimerization.

##### Ion Channel Receptors
- A ligand-gated ion channel is a type of membrane channel receptor containing a region that can act as a “gate,” opening or closing the channel when the receptor changes shape, allowing or blocking the flow of specific ions, such as Na+ or Ca2+.
###### Ligand-gated ion channels are very important in the *nervous system.*
- Some of the gated ion channels are controlled by electrical signals instead of ligands; these ***voltage-gated ion channels are crucial to the functioning of the nervous system,

-Newer techniques that do not require crys- tallization, like ***cryo-EM***, have shown promise in determining the structures of cell-surface receptors.
$$HER2$$
***Some breast cancer patients have tumor cells with excessive levels  
of a receptor tyrosine kinase caled HER2. Using molecular biological techniques, researchers have developed a protein called Herceptin that binds to HER2 on cells and inhibits cell division, thus thwart- ing further tumor development.

# Intracellular Receptors

- Found in either cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells.
- To reach such a receptor, a signaling molecule passes through the target cell’s plasma membrane.
                                       A number of important signaling molecules  
can do this because they are either hydrophobic enough  
or small enough to cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
- Hydrophobic signaling molecules include ***steroid hormones****\ and ***thyroid hormones*** of animals.
- Another chemical signaling molecule that possesses an intracellular receptor is ***nitric oxide (NO)***, a gas.
- Once a hormone or other signaling molecule has entered a cell, its binding to an intracellular receptor changes the receptor into a hormone-receptor complex that is able to cause a response.

$$Aldosterone$$

*This hormone is secreted by cells of the adrenal gland (a gland that lies above the kidney), then travels through the blood and enters cells all over the body. However, a response occurs only in kidney cells because they alone contain receptors for aldosterone. In these cells, the hormone binds to and activates the receptor protein. With aldosterone attached, the active form of the receptor protein then enters the nucleus and turns on specific genes that control water and sodium flow in kidney cells, ultimately affecting blood volume.*

#### Q. How does the activated hormone-receptor complex turn on genes ?

```
-Transcription is the process in which a DNA sequence is transcribed into an RNA molecule with the help of enzyme RNA polymerase.
-Transcription begins when RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence near the beginning of a gene (directly or through helper proteins).-   
RNA polymerase uses one of the DNA strands (the template strand) as a template to make a new,complementary RNA molecule.
-Transcription ends in a process called termination. Termination depends on sequences in the RNA, which signal that the transcript is finished.
```

- DNA function by being transcribed and processed into messenger RNA, which leaves the nucleus and is translated into a specific protein by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. 
- Special proteins called ***Transcription factors*** control which genes are turned on i.e, which genes are transcribed into mRNA 
   likewise when aldosterone receptor is activated ,it acts as a transcription factor that turns on specific genes.
- By acting as a transcription factor, the aldosterone receptor itself carries out two parts of the signaling pathway, as receptor and transducer. 
  Most other intracellular receptors function in the same way, although many of them, such as the thyroid hormone receptor, are already in the nucleus before the signaling molecule reaches them. Interestingly, many of these intracellular receptor proteins are structurally similar, suggesting an evolutionary kinship.

# Signal transduction
- Transduction stage is a multistep process involves many molecules.
- Includes activation of proteins by addition and removal of phosphate groups or release of other small molecules or ions that act as signaling molecules
 ###### Benefit of using a multi steps is that a signal caused by a small number of signaling molecules can be greatly amplified.
- If each molecule transmits the signal to numerous molecules at the next step in the series, the result is a ***geometric increase*** in the number of activated molecules by the end.
 ###### Another benefit of using a multistep pathway is that they provide more oppurtunities for coordination and control than do simpler systems. This allows regulation of the response.
- Many of the relay molecules in a signal transduction pathway are protein kinases and often act on other protein kinases in the pathway.
