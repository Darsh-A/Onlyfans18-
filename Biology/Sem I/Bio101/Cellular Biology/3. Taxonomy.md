**Taxonomy** is the branch of biology that names and classifies species into groups of increasing breadths.

## Importance of Taxonomy

- Approximately 1.8 million species have been identified and named to date, and thousand more are identified each year. Grouping them into categories allows scientists some reductional approach into understanding each species.
- Having a unique name is important for exchange of information between people from various regions around the globe.

### Three Domain System

- The *three-domain system* is currently used and it replaces the old **five-kingdom system**.
- **Domain Bacteria** and **Domain Archaea** comprise the prokaryotes.
- **Domain Eukarya** includes all eukaryotic organisms. ![Three Domain System][https://microbiologynote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Carl-Woeses-Classification-Three-Domain-Classification-1536x864.jpg]
- The domain **Eukarya** includes three *multicellular* kingdoms:
	1. Plantae
	2. Fungi
	3. Animalia

- Other eukaryotic organisms were formerly grouped into a kingdom called *Protista*, though these are now grouped into many separate kingdoms.

## Unity In Diversity

A striking unity underlies the diversity of life; for example:
- DNA and RNA are the universal genetic languages common to all organisms
- Unity is evident in many features of the cell structure which allows for efficient and coordinated cellular processes.

- For example, the cytoskeleton provides structural support and organization for the cell, while also facilitating cell movement and division.

- The plasma membrane serves as a selective barrier that regulates the exchange of materials between the cell and its environment, and contains various receptors and channels that mediate communication with other cells.

- Additionally, organelles such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus work together to synthesize, modify, and transport proteins and other molecules throughout the cell.

- This high degree of organization and coordination is essential for cellular function and survival. Without unity among these various components, the cell would not be able to carry out its many complex processes.
