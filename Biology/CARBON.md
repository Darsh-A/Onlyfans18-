# Evolution 

- In 1953, Stanley Miller, a graduate student of Harold Urey at the University of Chicago, designed an experiment on the abiotic
   (nonliving) synthesis of organic compounds to investigate the origin of life.
- Miller concluded that complex organic molecules could arise spontaneously under conditions thought at that time to have existed on early Earth.
- These experiments support the idea that abiotic synthesis of organic compounds, perhaps near vol- canoes, could have been an early stage in the origin of life
==In 2018, rover *Curiosity* that had found carbon based compounds on Mars in a crater where a lake once existed reported by NASA. These compounds might have been by some meteorites or formed by geologic processes.
