- *Chromosomes* contain most of a cell's genetic material in the form of **DNA**.
- **Genes** are the units of inheritance that transmit information from parents to off-springs.
- Each chromosome has one long DNA molecule with hundreds or thousands of genes on it.
- Each DNA molecule is made up of two long chains arranged in a *double helix*
- Each link of a chain is one of four kinds of chemical building blocks called **nucleotides**.
- DNA is transcribed into *RNA* and then translated into a **protein**.
- An organism's **genome** is its entire set of genetic instructions.
- The human genome and those of many other organisms have been sequenced using *DNA Sequencing machines*.
