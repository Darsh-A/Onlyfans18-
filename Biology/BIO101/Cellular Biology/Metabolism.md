- Totality of an organism's chemical reaction is called metabolism.
- it is an emergent property of life that arises from orderly interactions between molecules.

# First law of Thermodynamics

- Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created nor destroyed.
- Also known as principle of conservation of energy.

# Second law of Thermodynamics

- Every energy transformation increases the entropy of the universe.
- The more randomly arranged a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy.
- If a given process, by itself, leads to an increase in entropy, that process can proceed without requiring an input of energy. Such a process is called a spontaneous process.

## Metabolic pathways



 



- In a metabolic pathway, a specific molecule is altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a certain product.
- Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme which speeds up a chemical reaction.
- The mechanisms that regulate these enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand.

- It manages the material and energy resources of the cell.
- Some release energy by breaking down(**catabolic pathways**) complex molecules.
```
One major catabolic pathway is cellular respiration, which breaks down glucose and other organic fuels in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. 
```

- Some consume energy to build complicated molecules from simplier ones called **anabolic pathways** or **Biosynthetic pathways** 
```
Synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and syn- thesis of a protein from amino acids.
```
- Energy released from downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive uphill reactions of anabolic pathways.

## Forms of Energy

- Kinetic energy
- Thermal energy
- Potential energy
- Chemical energy
(Guys you know the definitions or if you don't start from class 6 all over again)

## Laws of Energy Transformation

- Study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called thermodynamics.
- Organisms are open systems.

## Biological order and Disorder 

- Increase in order is balanced by an organism’s taking in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replacing them with less ordered forms.
```
An animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases CO2 and H2O
```

- Depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism.

## Free Energy Change

- In 1878 Willard Gibbs, a professor at Yale defined the function called Gibbs free energy of a system.
- Free energy is the portion of a system’s energy that can perform work when temperature and pressure are uniform throughout the system, as in a living cell.
                                               ∆G = ∆H - T∆S

∆H= Change in system's Enthalpy
∆S= Change in the systems's Entropy
T=  Absolute temperature in kelvin(K)

- Every spontaneous process decreases the system’s free energy, and processes that have a positive or zero  ∆G  are never spontaneous.
- For ∆G to be negative,  ∆H  must be negative (the system gives up enthalpy and H decreases) or T∆S must be positive (the system gives up order and S increases),or both: When DH and TDS are tallied, DG has a negative value (∆G 6 0) for all spontaneous processes.

## Free Energy, Stability, and Equilibrium

- ∆G is difference between the free energy of the final state and the free energy of the initial state 
                           ∆G = G(final state) - G(initial state)

- Unstable systems (higher G) tend to change in such a way that they become more stable (lower G).
- Free energy increases when a reaction is somehow pushed away from equilibrium.
- Any change from the equilibrium position will have a positive ∆G and will not be spontaneous. For this reason, systems never spon- taneously move away from equilibrium.
- A process is spontaneous and can perform work only when it is moving toward equilibrium.

## Free Energy and Metabolism

### Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions in Metabolism

- Based on free energy changes, chemical reactions can be classified as exergonic (Energy Outward) or endergonic (Energy Inward).
- ∆G is negative for an exergonic reaction.
- Exergonic reactions  occur spontaneously.
- Magnitude of DG for an exergonic reaction represents the maximum amount of work the reaction can perform.
- Greater the decrease in free energy, the greater the amount of work that can be done.

### Equilibrium and Metabolism

- Chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible.
- **Metabolism as a whole is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life.**
- Some of the reversible reactions of respiration are constantly “pulled” in one direction—that is, they are kept out of equilibrium.
                       -key to maintaining this lack of equilibrium is that the product of a reaction does not accumulate but instead becomes a reactant in the next step.

# ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions

A cell does three kinds of work:

- **Chemical work:-** Pushing of endergonic reactions that would not occur spontaneously.
- **Transport work:-** Pumping of substances across membranes against the direction of spontaneous movement.
- **Mechanical work:-** Examples like contraction of muscle cells, Movement of chromosomes during cellular reproduction.
- *A key feature in the way cells manage their energy resources to do this work is energy coupling, the use of an exergonic process to drive and endergonic one*
- ATP is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells. It also acts as the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work.

## Structure and hydrolysis of ATP

- It contains the sugar ribose, with the nitrogenous base adenine and a chain of three phosphate groups( the triphosphate group) bonded to it.
- ATP is also one of the nucleoside triphosphates used to make RNA.
- When the terminal phosphate bond is broken by addition of a water molecule, a molecule of inorganic phosphate leaves the ATP, which becomes adenosine diphosphate, or ADP. The reaction is exergonic and releases 7.3 kcal of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed.
                                    ATP + H2O ----> ADP + Pi

- Because their hydrolysis releases energy, the phosphate bonds of ATP are sometimes referred to as  high-energy phosphate bonds (This is false).
- The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, rather the reactants themselves have high energy relative to the energy of products( ADP and Pi).
- The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change of the system to a state of lower free energy.

## How ATP provides Energy that performs work

For example, with the help of specific enzymes, the cell is able to use the high free energy of ATP to drive chemical reactions that, by themselves, are endergonic. If the DG of an endergonic reaction is less than the amount of energy released by ATP hydrolysis, then the two reactions can be coupled so that, overall, the coupled reactions are exergonic. This usually involves phosphorylation, the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to some other molecule, such as the reactant. The recipient molecule with the phosphate group covalently bonded to it is then called a **phosphorylated intermediate.**
