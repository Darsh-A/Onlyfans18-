- Totality of an organism's chemical reaction is called metabolism.
- it is an emergent property of life that arises from orderly interactions between molecules.

# First law of Thermodynamics

- Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created nor destroyed.
- Also known as principle of conservation of energy.

# Second law of Thermodynamics

- Every energy transformation increases the entropy of the universe.
- The more randomly arranged a collection of matter is, the greater its entropy.
- If a given process, by itself, leads to an increase in entropy, that process can proceed without requiring an input of energy. Such a process is called a spontaneous process.

## Metabolic pathways



 



- In a metabolic pathway, a specific molecule is altered in a series of defined steps, resulting in a certain product.
- Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme which speeds up a chemical reaction.
- The mechanisms that regulate these enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand.

- It manages the material and energy resources of the cell.
- Some release energy by breaking down(**catabolic pathways**) complex molecules.
```
One major catabolic pathway is cellular respiration, which breaks down glucose and other organic fuels in the presence of oxygen to carbon dioxide and water. 
```

- Some consume energy to build complicated molecules from simplier ones called **anabolic pathways** or **Biosynthetic pathways** 
```
Synthesis of an amino acid from simpler molecules and syn- thesis of a protein from amino acids.
```
- Energy released from downhill reactions of catabolic pathways can be stored and then used to drive uphill reactions of anabolic pathways.

## Forms of Energy

- Kinetic energy
- Thermal energy
- Potential energy
- Chemical energy
(Guys you know the definitions or if you don't start from class 6 all over again)

## Laws of Energy Transformation

- Study of the energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called thermodynamics.
- Organisms are open systems.

## Biological order and Disorder 

- Increase in order is balanced by an organism’s taking in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replacing them with less ordered forms.
```
An animal obtains starch, proteins, and other complex molecules from the food it eats. As catabolic pathways break these molecules down, the animal releases CO2 and H2O
```

- Depletion of chemical energy is accounted for by heat generated during metabolism.
