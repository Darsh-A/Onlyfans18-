Feedback mechanisms allow biological processes to self regulate.
There are two types of feedback mechanism:
- Negative Feedback Mechanism
- Positive Feedback Mechanism

## Negative Feedback Mechanism

*Negative Feedback* means that as more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it **slows** and **less** of the product is produced.

### Examples
- When the stomach content becomes too acidic, the release of *gastrin* is inhibited. Lower levels of gastrin in the blood cause gastric glands to secrete less gastric juice.
- Androgens carried in blood help maintain homeostasis by inhibiting secretion of both *FSH and LH*.
- The production of red blood cells in the *bone marrow* is controlled by a negative-feedback mechanism that is sensitive to the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues via the blood.
- Shivering and Sweating are methods of **Thermoregulation** used by the body to maintain its temperature. ![Thermoregulation][https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/negative-feedback_med.jpeg]

## Positive Feedback Mechanism

Positive feedback means that as more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it *speeds up* and **more of the product** is produced.

If we take a look at any system at **homeostasis**, a positive feedback mechanism generally moves the system *further away from the target of equilibrium*. Therefore, positive feedback mechanisms are **rare** in biological systems.

### Examples

- The release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland during labor. Oxytocin stimulates the muscle contraction that push the baby through the birth canal. ![Oxytocin Positive Feedback Loop][https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/positive-feedback_med.jpeg]
- Child feeding stimulates milk production which causes further feeding.
- Platelets release more clotting factor which causes more platelets to aggregate at the site of injury.
