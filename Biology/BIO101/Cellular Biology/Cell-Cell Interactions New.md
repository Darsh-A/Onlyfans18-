## Cell Junctions

### Plasmodesmata (Plant Cells)
- The cytoplasm of one plant cell is continuous with the cytoplasm of its neighbors via *plasmodesmata* which are cytoplasmic channels through the cell walls. By joining adjacent cells, plasmodesmata unify most of the plant into one living unit. 
- Water and small solutes can pass freely from cell to cell, and several experiments have shown that in some circumstances, certain proteins and RNA molecules can do this as well.
- The macromolecules transported to neighboring cells appear to reach the plasmodesmata by moving along fibers of the cytoskeleton

### Gap Junctions (Animal Cells)
- Gap junctions (also called communicating junctions) provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjacent cell and in this way are similar in their function to the plasmodesmata in plants.
- Gap junctions consist of membrane proteins extending from the membranes of the two cells.
- These proteins create pores through which ions, sugars, amino acids, and other small molecules may pass.
