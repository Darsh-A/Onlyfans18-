## Plasma vs Serum

### Plasma
It is the liquid, cell-free part of blood that has been treated with **anti-coagulants**.

### Serum
It is the liquid part of blood *after coagulation*, therefore devoid of any clotting factors like **fibrinogen**.

## Types of Immune Defenses
Three types of defense mechanisms provide antimicrobial immunity.
- The first line of defense comprise of mechanical and chemical barriers that are intact skin, mucosal surfaces laden with mucocilliary-expulsion system and anti-microbials.
- Second line of defense includes *innate immune responses* that comprise of both *humoral and cellular components*. The humoral components are **complement proteins, defensins, lysozymes** in various secretions and cellular components consist of innate immune cells such as **neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, etc.**.
