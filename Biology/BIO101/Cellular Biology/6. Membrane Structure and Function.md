## Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins with many functions

Biologists use the fluid mosaic model to describe a membrane's structure i.e., a diverse protein molecules suspended in a fluid phospholipid bilayer.
This model illustrates the structure and function of a plasma membrane.

### Fluid Mosaic Model
The ***Lipid Bilayer model*** is a subset of ***Fluid Mosaic Model*** as it also contains Lipid Bilayers but with additional **Proteins** and **Glycolipids**
Additional **Globular Proteins** are also embedded into the lipid bilayer

- ***Fluid Mosaic Model*** was formatted by Singer-Nicolson (1972)
- ***Lipid Bilayer Model*** was formatted by Gorter and Grender (1925)
- ***Sandwich Model*** was formatted by Danielli-Dawson (1935)

### Cell Recognition
- The **Glycolipids** & **Glycoproteins** also help in cell recognition
- They are usually branched *oligosaccharides* (<15 monomers)
- They are covalently bonded to lipids and proteins respectively


------------------

## The spontaneous formation of membranes was a critical step in the origin of life

#### Phospholipids
- Among the first organic molecules that formed from chemical reactions on early Earth
- These lipids could spontaneously self-assemble into simple membranes.
	  We can demonstrate this by shaking phospholipids and water. The lipids will form a bilayer surrounding around water-filled bubbles
- The Phospholipids can arrange themselves laterally
- very easily and move faster than the proteins

### Types of Phospholipids

$Q.$ *What is the basic requirement for life to form?*
> A membrane that not only encloses a successful assembly of molecules but also regulates chemical exchanges with the environment.
> For regulation the membrane should contain proteins embedded into it, cause only simple lipid bilayers are not sufficient

## Membrane Fluidity

#### Temperature
As Temperature decreases the phospholipids come close to each other i.e., the *distance* between them decreases, which decreases the Fluidity
Similarly, Fluidity increases with increase in Temperature

#### Cholesterol (buffer)
Cholesterol inserts itself between the phospholipids through the help of vesicles and transmembrane proteins.
At low temperature, due to insertion of cholesterol the distance between the Phospholipids increases thus fluidity increases.
At High Temperature, insertion of cholesterol brings the phospholipids close together as they were already far apart, which decreases the fluidity.

#### Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids
Saturated fatty acids decreases the fluidity while
Unsaturated fatty acids increases the fluidity.

---------------------

## Membrane Proteins

### Integral Proteins (Intrinsic)
- Directly incorporated within the lipid bilayer and tightly bound
- Provides a channel for the water-soluble substances
- ***Transmembrane Proteins & Transport Proteins***

#### 1. Ion Channel
Allows specific ion to move through water-filled pore. Most plasma membranes include specific channels for several common ions.

#### 2. Transporter
Transports specific substances across membrane by changing shape. For Ex, Amino acids, needed to synthesize new proteins, enter body cells via transporters

#### 3. Receptor
Recognizes specific ligand and alters cell's function is one way. For ex, Anti-diuretic hormone binds to receptors in the kidneys and changes the water permeability of certain plasma membranes.

#### 4. Enzyme
Catalyzes reaction inside or outside cell. For Ex, lactase protruding from epithelial cells lining your small intestine splits the disaccharide lactose in the milk you drink.

#### 5. Linker
Anchors filaments inside and outside to the plasma membrane, providing structural stability. May also participate in movement of the cell or link two cells together.

### Peripheral Proteins (Extrinsic)
- On Membrane surface and located entirely outside of the lipid bilayer
- Either on the extracellular or cytoplasmic surface

#### 1. Cell identity Marker
Distinguishes your cells from anyone else's. (***Unless an identical Twin***).
An important class of such markers are the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Proteins.

### Transport Protein
Integral Membrane Proteins that transport specific ions or molecules across the membrane.

![Types of Transport Proteins](https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Transport-Proteins.jpg)
- Composed of Lipids, Proteins and Carbohydrates
- Lipids of cell membrane are
  - Phospholipids
  - Glycolipids
  - Sterol 
  - Cholesterol

Hydrophilic Substances like ions and moderately sized polar molecules through transport proteins. They may provide a hydrophilic tunnel or may bind to, and physically carry a substance across.

## Passive Transport is diffusion across a membrane with no energy investment

***Diffusion:*** 
- The tendency for particles of any substance to spread out into the available space
- Two or more substances diffuse independently of each other, i.e, each diffuses down its own ***concentration gradient***
- Because cell does not have to do work when molecules diffuse across its membrane, such movement is called ***PASSIVE TRANSPORT***
  i.e., the cells does not expend energy to transport substances that are diffusing down their concentration levels
- Much of the **Traffic** across membranes occurs by diffusion.

$Q.$ Can ions and polar molecules also diffuse across the hydrophobic interior of a membrane?
> They can if they are moving down their concentration gradients and if they have transport proteins to help them cross.

### Passive Transport
- down Concentration Gradient
- Helps polar molecules get through lipid bilayers
- Can be saturated with solute (rate limited) (all carriers get occupied)
- Can be due to conformational changes
- Can be gated channels (open closing of the proteins)

##### Passive Transport for ions depends on:
- Concentration gradient of the ion
- Effect of the membrane potential of the ion
- The ***Electrochemical Gradient*** (**a measure of the free energy available to carry out the useful work of transporting the molecule across the membrane**.) is the diffusion gradient created from the combined effects of both of the above

### Active Transport
- Endergonic process by which a transport protein pumps a molecule across a membrane against its concentration gradient.
- These maintain concentration gradients across membranes
- Use ATP as energy source.
- Ex. Sodium-Potassium Pump

![Active Transport](https://github.com/Drosophilaa/College_Notes/blob/main/101/BIO101/data/images/Pasted%20image%2020221217162106.png?raw=true)

### Two models for facilitated diffusion/transport

## Permeability of Lipid Bilayer

### Non-Polar Molecules
- Dissolve in membranes, cross with ease
- Smaller ones will cross faster

### Polar Molecules
- Small, uncharged molecules can slip through
- Larger, uncharged will not get through easily (Ex, Glucose)
- All ions have trouble getting through hydrophobic layer

## Membrane Potential

- Voltage across membranes happens when anions/cations are unequally distributed across cell membranes 
- Potential ranges from $-50 \rightarrow -200$ mv
- Negative sign indicates the inside of the cell is charged
- Affects traffic of charged substances across membrane, favors diffusion of anions out, cations in.

### Factors contributing to Membrane Potential

- Negatively charged proteins in the cells interior
- Plasma membrane's selective permeability to various ions

***Electrogenic Pump:*** A transport Protein which generates voltage across a membrane

- The ***Sodium-Potassium pump*** ($Na^{+}/K^{+}$ ATPase) is the major one in Animals, ***Proton Pump*** is major one in Plants, bacteria, fungi (also mitochondria and chloroplasts use it to make ATP)

***Sodium-Potassium Pump (A Cotransporter)***
![Sodium Potassium Pump](https://github.com/Drosophilaa/College_Notes/blob/main/101/BIO101/data/images/Pasted%20image%2020221217163705.png?raw=true)

***Proton Pump***

### Co-Transport
A process where a single ATP-powered pump actively transports (with the help of ATP) one solute, and indirectly drives the transport of other solutes against their concentration gradients.

Here the $H^{+}$ requires ATP (active transport) where as the Glucose doesn't (indirect/passive transport)
Can be seen in Sodium-Potassium Pump

## Exocytosis and Endocytosis

### Exocytosis
- Exportation of macromolecules by the fusion of vesicles with membrane
- Vesicle comes from ER or Golgi
- Used by ***secretory cells*** to export products

### Endocytosis
- Importation of macromolecules into a cell by ofrming vesicles from membrane
- Used by cells to incorporate extracellular substances

#### The three types of Endocytosis

```ad-note
title: Phagocytosis
color: 255,0,0
Cell eating solid particles involved. Cells engulfs them with pseudopods. The vesicle then fuses with a food vacuole
```

```

```ad-note
title: Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis
color: 0,255,255
- Receptor proteins for specific molecules are embedded in regions of the membrane that are lined by a layer of coat proteins. The plasma membrane indents to form a coated pit, whose receptor proteins pick up particular molecules from the extracellular fluid. The coated pit pinches closed to form a vesicle, which then releases the molecules into the cytoplasm.
- A Layer of CLATHARIN, a fibrous protein, lines and reinforces the coated pit, probably causing it to deepen the pit to form a vesicle
- Example: Cholesterol and LDL's
