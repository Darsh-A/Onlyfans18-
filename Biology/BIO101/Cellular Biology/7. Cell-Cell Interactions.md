## Cell Junctions

### Plasmodesmata (Plant Cells)
- The cytoplasm of one plant cell is continuous with the cytoplasm of its neighbors via *plasmodesmata* which are cytoplasmic channels through the cell walls. By joining adjacent cells, plasmodesmata unify most of the plant into one living unit.
- Water and small solutes can pass freely from cell to cell, and several experiments have shown that in some circumstances, certain proteins and RNA molecules can do this as well.

### Gap Junctions (Animal Cells)
- Gap junctions (also called communicating junctions) provide cytoplasmic channels from one cell to an adjacent cell and in this way are similar in their function to the plasmodesmata in plants.
- Gap junctions consist of membrane proteins extending from the membranes of the two cells.
- These proteins create pores through which ions, sugars, amino acids, and other small molecules may pass.

## Classification of Cell Signaling based on Distance
Cells in a multicellular organism communicate by chemical messengers.
- **Local Signaling**:
	- The animal cells may communicate by direct contact or cell-cell recognition.
	-  Many animal and plant cells have cell junctions that directly connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells.
	- In these cases, signaling substances dissolved in **cytosol** can pass between neighboring cells.
	- This type of cell signaling is important in *embryonic development*, the *immune response* and in *maintaining the adult stem cell populations*.
- **Long Distance Signaling**:
	- For long distance signaling both plants and animals use hormones.
	- Specialized endocrine cells secrete hormones into body fluids.
	- Through this media, the hormones are able to reach virtually every cell in the body.

## Cell Communication
There are *5* basic mechanisms for cellular communication:
- Direct Contact
- Paracrine and Autocrine Signaling
- Synaptic Signaling
- Endocrine Signaling
In many cases, animal cells communicate using *local regulators* which are messenger molecules that travel only short distances.
*Hormones* are the primary chemicals used for long distance signaling.
The **ability of a cell to respond** to a signal depends on whether or not it has the **receptor specific** to the chemical.

## Cell Signaling

- *Earl W. Sutherland* discovered how the hormone **epinephrine** acts on the cells.
- The three step process of cells receiving signals.
	1. Reception
	2. Transduction
	3. Response

### Reception
- The binding between a signal molecule and receptor is highly specific.
- A **shape change** in a receptor is often the *initial transduction* of the signal.
- Most signal receptors are **plasma membrane proteins**.

#### Receptors in the Plasma Membrane
- Most water-soluble signal molecules bind to specific sites on receptor proteins that span the plasma membrane.
- There are three main types of membrane receptors:
	- *G protein-coupled receptors*
	- *Receptor tyrosine kinases*
	- *Ion channel receptors*

```ad-note

color: 30, 215, 96
- **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)** are the largest family of cell-surface receptors.
- A GPCR is a *plasma membrane* receptor that works with the help of a *G protein*
- The G protein acts like an on/off switch. If GDP is bound to the G protein, the G protein is inactive.

title: Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
color: 182, 181, 214
- Receptor tyrosine kinases are membrane receptors that attach **phosphates** to **tyrosines**.
- A receptor tyrosine kinase can trigger multiple signal transduction pathways at once.
- *Abnormal functioning* of RTKs is associated with many types of *cancers*.

color: 245, 148, 120
- A *ligand-gated ion channel* receptor acts as a gate when the receptor changes shape.
- When a signal molecule binds as a ligand to the receptor, the gate allows specific ions, such as $\text{Na}^{+}$ or $\text{Ca}^{2+}$, through a channel in the receptor.

#### Intracellular Receptors
- Intracellular receptor proteins are found in the cytosol or nucleus of target cells.
- Small or hydrophobic chemical messengers can readily cross the membrane and activate receptors.
- Examples of hydrophobic messengers are the steroid and thyroid hormones of animals.
- An activated hormone-receptor complex can act as a transcription factor, turning on specific genes.

### Transduction

- Signal transduction usually involves multiple steps.
- Multistep pathways can amplify a signal: A few molecules can produce a large cellular response.
- Multistep pathways provide more opportunities for coordination and regulation of the cellular response.

```ad-note
title: Signal Transduction Pathways
color: 240,180,68
- The molecules that relay a signal from receptor to responses are mostly proteins.
- Like falling sequential dominoes, the receptor activates another protein, which activates another, and so on, until the protein producing the response is activated.
- At each step, the signal is transduced into a different form, usually a shape change in a protein.

```

```ad-note
title: Protein Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation
color: 255, 255, 255
- In many pathways, the signal is transmitted by a cascade of protein phosphorylation.
- **Protein kinases** transfer phosphates from ATP to protein, a process called phosphorylation.
- **Protein phosphatases** remove the phosphates from proteins, a process called dephosphorylation.
- This phosphorylation and dephosphorylation system acts as a molecular switch, turning activities on and off or up or down, as required.

#### Small Molecules and Ions as Second Messengers
- The extracellular signal molecule (ligand) that binds to the receptor is a pathway's *first messenger*.
- **Second messengers** are small, non-protein, water-soluble molecules or ions that spread throughout a cell by diffusion.
- Second messengers participate in pathways initiated by GPCRs and RTKs
- Cyclic AMP and calcium ions are common second messengers.

##### Cyclic-AMP
- Cyclic AMP is one of the most widely used second messengers.
- **Adenylyl cyclase**, an enzyme in the plasma membrane, converts ATP to cAMP in response to an extracellular signal.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yFHZPlT.png)

- Many signal molecules trigger formation of cAMP
- Other components of cAMP pathways are G proteins, G protein-coupled receptors, and protein kinases.
- cAMP usually activates *protein kinase A*, which phosphorylates various other proteins.
- Other type of regulation of cell metabolism is provided by G-protein systems that inhibit adenylyl cyclase.

##### Calcium Ions and Inositol Trisphosphate ($\text{IP}_{3}$)
- Calcium ions act as a second messenger in many pathways.
- Calcium is an important second messenger because cells can regulate its concentration.
- A signal relayed by a signal transduction pathway may trigger an increase in calcium in the cytosol.
- Pathways leading to the release of calcium involve **inositol triphosphate** ($\text{IP}_{3}$) and diacylglycerol (DAG) as additional second messengers.

### Response
The cell's response to an extracellular signal is sometimes called the "output response".
#### Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Responses
- Ultimately, a signal transduction pathway leads to regulation of one or more cellular activities.
- The response may occur in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus.
- Many signaling pathways regulate the synthesis of enzymes or other proteins, usually by turning genes on or off in the nucleus.
- The final activated molecule in the signaling pathway may function as a transcription factor.
- Other pathways regulate the activity of enzymes rather than their synthesis

## Cell Communication
- A cell’s response to a signal often involves activating or inactivating proteins.
- Phosphorylation is a common way to change the activity of a protein.
- *Protein kinase* – an enzyme that adds a phosphate to a protein.
- *Phosphatase* – an enzyme that removes a phosphate from a protein.
- Signaling pathways can also affect the overall behavior of a cell, for example, changes in the cell shape.

### Cell to cell interactions
- Cells can identify each other by cell surface markers.
- **Glycolipids** are commonly used as *tissue-specific* markers.
- **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)** proteins are used by the cells to distinguish *self from non-self* cells.

#### Cell Junctions
Cells within a tissue are connected to each other by **cell junctions**.
1. **Anchoring junctions**: Connect the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells.
2. **Tight junctions**: Create sheets of cells.
3. **Signal-relaying junctions**
4. **Communicating (channel forming) junctions**: Permit small molecules to pass between cells.
