1.  Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. Some ATP is produced during this stage.
    
2.  The citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle): This stage occurs in the mitochondria and involves the oxidation of pyruvate to CO2, the production of NADH and FADH2, and the formation of a number of high-energy intermediates.
    
3.  Electron transport chain (ETC): This stage also occurs in the mitochondria and involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, producing water and a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. The majority of ATP is produced during this stage.

title: Cell respiration
1.  Glucose gets broken down in glycolysis.
2.  Pyruvate is oxidized in the citric acid cycle to release energy.
3.  Energy is captured through the electron transport chain in the mitochondria.
