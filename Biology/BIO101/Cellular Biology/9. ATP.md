1.  Glycolysis: This stage takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. Some ATP is produced during this stage.
    
2.  The citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle): This stage occurs in the mitochondria and involves the oxidation of pyruvate to CO2, the production of NADH and FADH2, and the formation of a number of high-energy intermediates.
    
3.  Electron transport chain (ETC): This stage also occurs in the mitochondria and involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, producing water and a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. The majority of ATP is produced during this stage.

title: Cell respiration
1.  Glucose gets broken down in glycolysis.
2.  Pyruvate is oxidized in the citric acid cycle to release energy.
3.  Energy is captured through the electron transport chain in the mitochondria.

Verse 1: Glucose and oxygen, they're all we need To produce energy, our cells succeed It starts with glycolysis, in the cytoplasm Where glucose is broken down, into pyruvam

Chorus: Cellular respiration, it's how we survive Turning glucose into energy, so our cells thrive With every step, we release a little heat It's how we keep going, can't you feel the beat?

Verse 2: Pyruvate moves on, into the mitochondria Where it's oxidized, in the citric acid cycle Carbon dioxide, it's released with every turn And ATP is produced, energy we've earned

Chorus: Cellular respiration, it's how we survive Turning glucose into energy, so our cells thrive With every step, we release a little heat It's how we keep going, can't you feel the beat?

Bridge: Electrons move on, down the electron transport chain With oxygen as the final acceptor, energy we gain More ATP is made, it's a beautiful sight Cellular respiration, powering us all night

Chorus: Cellular respiration, it's how we survive Turning glucose into energy, so our cells thrive With every step, we release a little heat It's how we keep going, can't you feel the beat?

Outro: So next time you're feeling tired and low Just remember how your cells make energy flow With every breath you take, oxygen you provide It's cellular respiration, it's how we survive
