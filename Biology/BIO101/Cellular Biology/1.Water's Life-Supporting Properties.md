## Hydrogen bonds make liquid water cohesive

#### Cohesion
Tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick together.

Trees depend on cohesion to help transport water and nutrients from their roots to their leaves. The evaporation of water from a leaf exerts a pulling force on water within the veins of the leaf. Because of Cohesion, the force is relayed all the way down to the roots.

#### Adhesion
The tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another.

The thinness of a plant's veins enhances the adhesion of water to its cell walls, helping to counter the downward pull of gravity.

#### Surface Tension
A measure of how Difficult it is to stretch or break the surface of a liquid.
Hydrogen-Bonds give water unusually high surface tension


$Q.$ After a hard workout, you may notice “beads” of sweat on your face. Can you explain what holds the sweat in droplet form on your face?
>The Cohesion of water molecules and its high surface tension hold water in droplets. The Adhesion of water to your skin helps hold the beads in place

## Water's Hydrogen bonds moderate Temperature

***Thermal Energy:*** 
>Energy associated with the random movement of atoms and molecules

***Heat:*** 
>Transfer of thermal energy from warmer to a cooler body of matter

***Temperature:***
>The Intensity of heat i.e, the average speed of molecules in a body of matter

As the breaking and rejoining of hydrogen bonds involves a lot of energy, water acts as a good moderator. For ex. Earth's giant water supply moderates temperatures, helping to keep temperatures within limits that permit life.
Also, as humans are $60$% water, it also helps moderator our temperature.

When a substance evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down. Because the molecules with the greatest energy leave.


$Q.$ Explain the popular adage, "It's not the heat, it's the humidity."
>HIgh humidity hampers cooling by slowing the evaporation of sweat.

## Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water

Water is less dense in solid state than in liquid due to Hydrogen-Bonds
Ice has a relatively loosely packed structure than water
i.e, The ice crystal has fewer molecules than an equal volume of liquid water.

This also explains why the whole oceons dont freeze up and only the top layer freezes

$Q.$ Explain how freezing water can crack boulders
>Water in the cervices of a boulder expands as it freezes because the water molecules become spaced farther apart as ice crystallizes (cause its less dense)

## Water is the solvent of Life

Water's versatility as a solvent results from the polarity of its molecules.
A compound doesnt need to be ionic to dissole in water. 
A spoonful of sugar will also dissolve in a glass of water. Polar molecules such as sugar dissolve as water molecules surround them and form hydrogen bonds with their polar regions.


$Q.$ Why are blood and most other biological fluids classified as aqueous solutions?
> The solvent in these fuild is water   
   (uh what????)

## The chemistry of life is sensitive to acidic and basic conditions

In Liquid water, a very small percentage of the water molecules dissociate or break apart into hydrogen ions ( $H^{+} \:\:\text{and} \:\:OH^{-}$) 
These ions are very reactive, and changes in their concentration can drastically affect a cell's proteins and other complex molecules.

#### Acid
A substance that donates hydrogen ions to solutions

#### Base
A substance that reduces the hydrogen ions concentration of a solution. 

A Human body has a pH of $7.4$
A person cant survive for than a few minutes if the blood pH drops to $7.0$ or rises to $7.8$

A ***Buffer*** minimizes the changes in pH by accepting $H^{+}$ when it is in excess and donating $H^{+}$ when it is depleted.

## Scientists study the effects of rising atmospheric $CO_{2}$ on coral reef ecosystems

#### Ocean Acidification
$CO_{2}$ dissolving in seawater lowers the pH of the ocean.
currently the ocean pH is about $8.1$ and will drop $0.3-0.5$ by end of century

#### Calcification
Coral animals combining calcium and carbonate ions to form their calcium carbonate skeletons. As seawater acidifies, the extra hydrogen ions combine with the carbonate ions ($CO_{3}^{2-}$) to form bicarbonate ions
This reactions reduces the carbonate ion concentration available to corals and other shell-building animals.
Scientists predict that ocean acidification will cause the carbonate ion concentration to decrease by $40$% hy $2100$

*The effect of carbonate ion concentration of calcification rate in an artificial coral reef system*
![[Pasted image 20221216005127.png]]

Keeping pH, temperature, and calcium ion concentration constant we see that
Lower the rate of Calcification the slower the growth of coral animals

Thus Ocean acidification and reduction in carbonate ion concentration will negatively affect coral reefs.

Even in a non controlled experiment, Scientists saw the same pattern with less structurally complex and slower-growing corals.
