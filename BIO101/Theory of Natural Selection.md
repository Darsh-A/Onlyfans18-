Charles Darwin published [On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species) in 1859.

He made two main points:
- Species showed evidence of "descent with modification" from common ancestors.
- Natural selection is the mechanism behind "descent with modification"

Darwin's theory explained the duality of unity and diversity.

## Darwin's Observations

- Individuals in a population have traits that vary.
- Many of these traits are heritable.
- More off-springs are produced than survive.
- Competition is inevitable.
- Species generally suit their environment.

### Darwin's Inference
- Individuals are best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.
- Over time, more individuals in population will have the advantageous traits.

In other words, the natural environment "selects" for beneficial traits.

- Natural Selection is often evident in adaptations of organisms to their way of life and environment.

## The Tree of Life
- Unity in diversity arises from "descent with modification".
	- For example, the forelimb of the bat, human, horse and the whale flipper all share a common skeletal architecture.
- Fossils provide additional evidence of anatomical unity from descent with modification.
- Darwin proposed that natural selection in an ancestral species could give rise to two or more descendants species. For example, the Finch Species of the Galapagos Islands.

- Evolutionary relationships are often illustrated with tree-like diagrams that show ancestors and their descendants.
