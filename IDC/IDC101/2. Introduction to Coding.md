To efficiently solve repetitive human day-to-day problems, we can break down the process and have a computer do it for us.

#### Computer-based solving process:
- Analyse the problem to define its principal components with their core functionalities (input/output).
- Develop an algorithm to go from input to output.
- Convert the written algorithm into a program using a programming language (this is coding).
- Test and debug
