### Types of Computers
- **Fixed program computer**: Function is specific and cannot be programmed.
- **Stored program computer**: Programmed to carry out many different tasks/application by keeping data and instructions stored on them.

### Computer Architechture:

#### Control Unit (CU)
- Manages instructions and communicates with both ALU and primary memory.
- Controls sequential instruction, execution etc.
- Guides the flow of data.

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):
- Executes arithmetic and logical operqations (comparison and relational operations)

#### Registers:
- Limited temporary and very fast computer memory for storing instructions and data on CPU (actual processor).
- They are under control of CU.
- Different types of registers are: accumulators, instruction register, memory address registers, memory data register, program counter and general purpose register. 

#### Cache:
- High speed memory in-built between CPU and primary memory.
- Different levels such as L1, L2 and L3.

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU):
- Executes program using fetch-decode-execute cycle.
