### Types of Computers
- **Fixed program computer**: Function is specific and cannot be programmed.
- **Stored program computer**: Programmed to carry out many different tasks/application by keeping data and instructions stored on them.

### Computer Architechture:

#### Control Unit (CU)
- Manages instructions and communicates with both ALU and primary memory.
- Controls sequential instruction, execution etc.
- Guides the flow of data.

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):
- Executes arithmetic and logical operqations (comparison and relational operations)

#### Registers:
- Limited temporary and very fast computer memory for storing instructions and data on CPU (actual processor).
- They are under control of CU.
- Different types of registers are: accumulators, instruction register, memory address registers, memory data register, program counter and general purpose register. 

#### Cache:
- High speed memory in-built between CPU and primary memory.
- Different levels such as L1, L2 and L3.

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU):
- Executes program using fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- **Ion know what fetch-decode-execute cycle is.**

#### Microprocessor:
- CPU implemented on a single microchip.
- Classified based on chip type, number of cores, processor type, word size memory size, clock speed, cache etc.
- **Word size**: Maximum number of bits a microprocessor can process at one time. Modern computers have either 32-bit or 64-bit machines.
- **Clock Speed**: Number of instructions a CPU can execute in a second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 GHz is 1 billion cycles per second.

#### Primary Memory:
- Stores data and instructions.
- **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: Volatile, retains data temporarily (measured in bytes).
- **Read Only Memory (ROM)**: Non-volatile memory, data which rarely changes such as boot loader that loads the operating system.
- **Virtual Memory**: Space allocated on storage devices.

#### Bus:
- Used for moving instructions and data around the system. Speed of bus is measured in Hertz. There are various kinds of
