Unix OS is a powerful multi-user and multi-tasking system developed in the 1970's for mainframe, servers and workstations.
- Developed by AT&T Bell labs by a team led by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie**.
- Open-source and comunity based development.

Features:
- Portability
- File Security
- Communication
- Command Line
- Graphics User Interface (GUI)

Varieties of UNIX:
- Sun Solaris
- Linux
- MacOS

### The UNIX is primarily made of three layers:

#### Kernel
- Hub or core of UNIX OS that maintains OS functionality through effectively communicating with hardware for various things such as to time/memory allocation to programs; device management, file handling, communication to system calls etc.

#### Shell
- Interface between kernel and user.
- Interprets the command submitted by user at terminal and executes the process. It is a Command Line Interpreter (CLI).
- Different types of shells are; Bourne Shell (sh), C shell (csh or tcsh), Korn Shell (ksh)

#### Programs
- They are programs

### Unix OS Data Structure Organization

This is a directory structure in UNIX file system. A file can be inside any of these folders and is a collection of data/commands.

### UNIX Commands
There are many UNIX commands. To know more about any UNIX command use the command `man 'command name'`.
For example: `man ls` gives the following window

#### File Permissions
Command to change permissions of a file is `chmod`. It can be used as:

where; 
- `u` represents giving permission to the user.
- `g` represents giving permission to the entire group.
- `o` represents giving permission to others.
- `r` represents giving read permissions.
- `w` represents giving write permissions.
- `x` represents giving execute permissions.

**Example**: 
`chmod u+rwx FILENAME` adds read, write and execute permissions to the user
`chmod ugo=r FILENAME` gives ONLY read permission to the user, group and others

**Another method to executing the same command is:**
`chmod` using number system;
where;
- `r` is given the numeric value **4**
- `w` is given the numeric value **2**
- `x` is given the numeric value **1**
and you add the numeric value for each permission you want to give.

This command is used in the form `chmod abc`
where;
- 'a' has to be substituted for the numeric value of the permissions to be assinged for 'users'
- 'b' has to be substituted for the numeric value of the permissions to be assigned for 'groups'
- 'c' has to be substituted for the numeric value of the permissions to be assigned for 'others'

**Example**:
`chmod 700` gives read, write and execute permissions to the user and no permissions to 
`chmod 764` gives read, write and execute permissions to the user; read and write permission to the group; and read permission to others
