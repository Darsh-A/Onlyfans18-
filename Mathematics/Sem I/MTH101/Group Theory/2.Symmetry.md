# Types of Symmetry

- Reflective Symmetry 
- Rotation  Symmetry
- Translation Symmetry

We only talk about these operations as they preserve ***shape***  and ***size***, i.e., they preserve the notion of distance between any two points

Rotation and Translation are ***Proper Symmetry*** cause they preserve orientation

While Reflection is a ***Improper*** Symmetry

----------------------------------

# Isometries

Let $A$ be a subset of P (Plane). An isometry of $A$ is a function 

$f: A  \to A$ such that 

- $f$ is a 1-1 correspondence
- $dist(x,y) = dist(f(x),f(y))$

Note: Isometry is a Rotation, Reflection & Translation only.

Glide Function: 

>Performing a translation followed by a reflection over a line that is parallel to the direction of the translation

### Properties:

**1**. Let $f,g$ be isometries of $A$, So $f,g$ are $1-1$ correspondence

   Such that $g \circ f$ is a $1-1$ correspondence 
   $dist(x,y) = dist(f(x),f(y)) =dist(g(f(x)),g(f(y)))$
   Such that $g\circ f$ is a Isometry

**2**. if $f$ is a isometry and a $1-1$ correspondence. Then, $f^{-1}$ exists and is also a $1-1$ correspondence and a Isometry
(Same proof as above)

**3**. if $f,g,h$ are isometries of $A$. Then,
   $f \circ (g \circ h) = (f\circ g)\circ h$
   This is because for any $x$ in $A$,  $(f \circ (g \circ h))(x)$ and $((f\circ g)\circ h)(x)$ are both equal to $f(g(h(x)))$
   
   **Note**: 

>This Property is true for all functions, not just isometries

   And we say that composition of functions is associative

***The Identity Function***:

> $f(x) = x$
> meaning, any operation made to the plane will return to the orientation we started with
> Example: Rotating a eq triangle by $\gamma^{3}$ (where $\gamma$ is a $120^{\circ}$ rotation)

For ***n=3*** (i.e. a Eq. Triangle)

Let,

- $\gamma$ = Rotation
- $\tau$ = Translation
- $\varphi$ = Reflection
![](https://i.imgur.com/DyzFrGs.png)

Here, There are 3 Rotations of $0$, $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, $\frac{4\pi}{3}$ ( $\gamma^3, \gamma^2, \gamma$ resp. )

And 3 Reflections $\tau_{0}, \tau_{1}, \tau_{2}$ along the perp. bisector

Note that here $\gamma^3$ is the *identity* 

Thus our symmetries are 

{ $id, \gamma^3, \gamma^2, \gamma, \tau_{0}, \tau_{1}, \tau_{2}$ }

### Compositions

For, $\gamma \circ \tau_{1} = \tau_{0}$

#### Composition Table: (for n=3)

|                       | id         | $\gamma$ | $\gamma^2$ | $\tau_{0}$ | $\tau_{1}$ | $\tau_{2}$ |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| id                    | id         | $\gamma$ | $\gamma^2$ | $\tau_{0}$ | $\tau_{1}$ | $\tau_{2}$ |
| $\gamma$              | $\gamma$   | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| $\gamma^2$            | $\gamma^2$ |          |            |            |            |            |
| $\tau_{0}$            | $\tau_{0}$ |          |            |            |            |            |
| $\tau_{1}$            | $\tau_{1}$ |          |            |            |            |            |
| $\tau_{2}$  |     $\tau_{2}$       |          |            |            |            |            |

### Important Observation:

If $P_{n}$ are the vertices of a n-gon

and $\sigma$ is some symmetry

Then, 

> If $\sigma(P_{0}) = P_{i}$ , then
> $\sigma(P_{1}) = P_{i+1}$  or  $P_{i-1}$

###### Compositions with Algebra:

1. Say, $l_{o}$ = line joining $P_{0}$ to midpoint of $P_{1} P_{n-1}$
	For, $\gamma^i  \varphi$ 
	$\varphi$ takes $P_{j}$ to  $P_{n-j}$ for each $j$
	$\gamma^j$ takes $P_{r}$ to $P_{r+j}$ for each $r$
	So,
		$\gamma^i  \varphi$ takes $P_{j}$ to $P_{n-j+i}$ for each j
		E.g., It takes $P_{0}$ to $P_{n-0+i} = P_{i}$
	Thus we see that $\gamma^i  \varphi$  is reflection in the line $l_{i}$
		And the n Reflections will be {$\varphi, \gamma \varphi, \dots, \gamma^{n-1}\varphi$}

2. What is $\varphi \gamma^i$ ?
    as it changes orientation it is some Reflection.
	    $\gamma^i$ takes $P_{0}$ to $P_{i}$ 
	    $\varphi$ takes $P_{i}$ to $P_{n-i}$
	    So, $\varphi \gamma^i$ takes $P_{0}$ to $P_{n-i}$
	Hence,  $$\varphi \gamma^i = \gamma^{n-i} \varphi$$Hence,
	We also know, 
		$P^{n-i}$ = inverse of $P_{i}$	
		So,$$

\varphi \gamma ^{i} = \gamma ^{-i} \varphi

$$
**Hence now we can calculate any composition**:

$$

\begin{align}

\gamma^2 \varphi \circ \gamma^3 \varphi &= \gamma^2 (\varphi \gamma^3) \varphi \\

&= \gamma^2 (\gamma^{-3}\varphi) \varphi \\

&= (\gamma^2\gamma^{-3})(\varphi \varphi) \\

&= \gamma^{-1} \\

&= \gamma^{n-1}

\end{align}

$$

> Observe when moving the operation inside a bracket or without one to the left it changes to its Inverse
