Let $A$ be a set with some *structure*.

$G =$ set of a permutations of $A$ preserving the structure.

Then $G$ has the following Properties:

1. $id_{A}$ is in $G$
2. $f,g$ in $G$ $\implies$ $g\circ f$ is in $G$
3. $f$ in $G$ $\implies$ $f^{-1}$ in $G$
4. if $f,g,h$ are in $G$, then 
   $f\circ(g\circ h) = (f\circ g) \circ h$ 

**Note:**

> We can understand more about $A$ and its structure if we understand $G$ and its composition rule

To understand $G$ we need to find these Properties:

- $G$ is a set
- There is a rule or operation to combine two elements of $G$ to get a third element
- $G$ has $id$
- Inverses
- The rule is associative

### Binary Operations

Let $S$ be a set. A binary operation on $S$ is a function 

$\ast: S$ x $S \to S$

Here, $S$ x $S$ = set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x,y$ are in $S$

The image of $(x,y)$ under $\ast$ will be written as $x \ast y$ instead of $\ast (x,y)$

Example:

> $\mathbb{N}$  $\to$ set of natural numbers
> 	Consider the function
> 	$\mathbb{N}$ x $\mathbb{N}$ $\to$ $\mathbb{N}$
> 	$(x,y)$ $\mapsto$ $x+y$
> This is a Binary Operation. (addition)

**Note:**

> We have already seen a associative binary operation example
> For, Non-Associative Binary Operation
> 	$\mathbb{Z}$ defined by
> 	$(a,b)$ $\mapsto$ $a-b$
> Then, if $a,b,c$ are in $\mathbb{Z}$
> 	$(a-b)-c = a-b-c$
> 	$a-(b-c) = a-b+c$
> This is NOT Associative

#### Properties of Groups:

A group consists of a set $G$ with a given binary operation $\ast$ : $G$ x $G$ $\to$ $G$

Such that,

>1. There exists an element $1_{G}$ in $G$ such that 
		   $1_{G} \ast f = f \ast 1_{G} = f$
		for all $f$ in $G$ 
>2. For any $f$ in $G$ , there exists an element $f^{-1}$ such that
		   $f \ast f^{-1} = f^{-1} \ast f = 1_{G}$
>3. $\ast$ is associative

Hence,
We write a group as $(G, \ast)$

and not just $G$

#### Existence of Groups:

Not every group will exist if it doesn't satisfy every group property

For e.g.,
- $\mathbb{N}$ is not a group for the bin operation "+" as inverses do not exist

- $\mathbb{R}$ does not exists under the operation "x"
However,  $\mathbb{R}^x =$ set of non-zero real numbers
Then, $(\mathbb{R}^{x}, x)$ is a group

#### Some Important Properties:

- Let $A$ be any set with a *distance function*
  Then, the set of [Isometries](2.Symmetry.md#Isometries) of $A$ is a Group

- The set of Isometries of a regular n-Gon is called the **Dihedral Group $(D_{n})$ of order $2n$**

--------------

### Related Ideas:

We know a Group is a pair of $(G, \ast)$

- There Exists an element $1_{G}$ such that 
  $f \ast 1_{G} = 1_{G} \ast f = f$
  for all $f$ in $G$
  
- For all $f$ in $G$ , there exists an element $f^{-1}$ such that 
  $f \ast f^{-1} = f^{-1} \ast f = 1_{G}$

- For any $f, g, h$ in $G$ (Associativity)
	  $(f \ast g) \ast h = f \ast (g \ast h)$

##### Cancellation Property

Let $a, b, c$ be elements of a group $G$

If, $ab = ac$ or $ba = ca$ then, $b = c$

***Proof***
> Suppose $ab = ac$
> Then, 
> 	$a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}(ac)$
> So,
> 	$1_{G} \cdot b = 1_{G} \cdot c$ 
> i.e., $b = c$

***Note***

> In general the above property is not true.
> $ab = ca \implies b = c$
> For Ex,
> 	In $D_{3}$, $\varphi ^{2}\tau =  \tau \varphi$
> 	However, we cannot cancel $\tau$ to get $\varphi ^{2} = \varphi$ 
> 	(which is false)

### More on Identity Element:

The axioms say that there exists some element $1_{G}$ such that 

	$f \ast 1_{G} = 1_{G} \ast f = f$ 

They d not explicitly say that there is only one such element 

However, we can deduce this 

##### Uniqueness of Identity

Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$ such that $f x = x$ for some $x$ in $G$.

Then, $f = 1_{G}$

***Proof***:

> $f x = x \implies f = 1_{G}$
> (By cancelling $X$ on the right)

Notice that we only needed to assume that $f x = x$ for some $x$, not necessarily all $x$ 

Also, we did not need to assume $xf = x$

--------------------------------

### Inverses:

Similarly, the axioms states that for any $f$ in $G$, there exists some $f^{-1}$, Such that

	$f \ast f^{-1} = f^{-1} \ast f = 1_{G}$

However we can deduce a stronger statement.

##### Uniqueness of Inverses:

Let $G$ be a group and let $f$ be an element of $G$.

If $h$ is an element such that $fh = 1_{G}$, then $h = f^{-1}$.

Similarly,

	if $h$ satisfies $hf = 1_{G}$, then

	$h = f^{-1}$.

***Proof***
>$$
>

\begin{align}

h &= 1_{G}\cdot h \\

&=(f^{-1}f) \cdot h \\

&=f^{-1}(fh) \\

&= f^{-1}1_{G} \\

&= f^{-1}

\end{align}

$$
    The proof in the case of $hf = 1_{G}$ is similar 

#### Inverses of a Product:

Note that if $a,b$ are in group $G$,
$(ab)^{-1}$ is not the same as $a^{-1}\cdot b^{-1}$
But we claim that
$$

(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}\cdot a^{-1}

$$
***Proof:***
> $$
\begin{align}
ab\cdot(b^{-1}a^{-1}) &= a(bb^{-1})a^{-1} \\
&= a\cdot 1_{G} \cdot a^{-1} \\
&= aa^{-1} \\
&= 1_{G}
\end{align}
$$
