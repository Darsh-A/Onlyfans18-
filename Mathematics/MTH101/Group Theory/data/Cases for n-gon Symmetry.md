### Case 1

If, 
   $\sigma(P_{1}) = P_{i+1}$ 
then,
   $\sigma(P_{2}) = P_{i+2}$  or $P_{i+3}$ etc
In fact the image of any vertex is uniquely determined.
   $\sigma(P_{j}) = P_{i+j}$

So, $\sigma$ = rotation through $\left( \frac{2\pi i}{n} \right)$

-------
### Case 2

if 
   $\sigma(P_{1}) = P_{i-1}$ 
   $\sigma(P_{2}) = P_{i-2}$
   ....etc
   
In general, 

   $\sigma(P_{j}) = P_{i-j}$

Now the vertex labels run clockwise. So $\sigma$ is not a rotation.

We see that, 
   $\varphi_{1}$ is the line of symmetry
Thus $\sigma$ is a Reflection in $\varphi_{1}$

>Also to find ${\varphi_{1}}$ connect the midpoints of $P_{0} P_{i}$ and $P_{1} P_{i-1}$

*Note:* 
> There are no other symmetries as any other function of symmetry will take $P_{0}$ to some $P_{i}$ which will not be a Refleciton

Hence, there are a total of $n$ Rotation
