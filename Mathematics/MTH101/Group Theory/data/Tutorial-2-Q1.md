## List all groups of order 6 and 7

We know that a group of order 6 would contain one set as
$$
({id, x, x^2, x^{3},x^{4}, x^{5}})
$$
Now, we need to find other sets of order 6

To do this, we need to find what can be the order of elements of the set

**Order of Element**
> power of an element which takes it to $id$

Lets take an element $y$ in the set
$$
(id, x, x^2, x^{3},x^{4}, y)
$$
Where,
-  $y^{2} = 1$  
    $y=y^{-1}$
    Thus order 2 element exists in our set
- $y^{3}=1$
   Thus order 3 element also exists in our set
- $y^{4}=1$
   which is equal to 
   $y^{2}=1$
   Thus order 4 does not exists
- $y^{5}=1$
  which returns to $id$

Thus a Group of order $6$ can only contain elements of order $2$ and $3$

**Note:**
> We want to do this problem without the use of Lagrange's Theorem

##### Thus to list other possible Sets of order 3
