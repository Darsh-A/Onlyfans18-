$m$x$n$ is a Matrix where $m$ is rows and $n$ are columns
(don't judge I get confused)


### Row Operations:

Operations on Equations in a System = Operations on rows in a matrix

- Replace $Row(i) \rightarrow Row(i)+a\cdot Row(j)$
    where $a \in \mathbb{R}$ : written as $R_{i}+aR_{j}$

-   Interchange $Row(i)$ and $Row(j)$ :  $R_{i} \leftrightarrow$
