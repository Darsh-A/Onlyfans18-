## Finite Dimensional Spaces

Recall that a space is finite dimensional if it has a finite spanning set.

Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $S=\{v_{1}\dots v_{n}\}$
is a spanning set.
 
If $S$ is not linearly independent, there is some $v_{i}$ such that
	$v_{i} \in Span(S \setminus \{v_{i}\})$
So, $Span(S \setminus \{v_{i}\}) = Span(S) = V$
