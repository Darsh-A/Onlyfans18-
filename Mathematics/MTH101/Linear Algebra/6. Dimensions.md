## Finite Dimensional Spaces

Recall that a space is finite dimensional if it has a finite spanning set.

Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $S=\{v_{1}\dots v_{n}\}$
is a spanning set.
 
If $S$ is not linearly independent, there is some $v_{i}$ such that
	$v_{i} \in Span(S \setminus \{v_{i}\})$
So, $Span(S \setminus \{v_{i}\}) = Span(S) = V$
Thus,
	$S \setminus \{v_{i}\}$ is a smaller spanning set.

Again, if $S \setminus\{v_{i}\}$ is not linearly independent, we can remove another element to create an even smaller spanning set.
This can continue at most $n$ times.
So, at some point, we must end up with a spanning set which is linearly independent.

## Basis

A ***Basis*** of $V$ is a spanning set which is linearly independent.
 - And, any finite spanning set of a finite dimensional vector space has a subset which is a ***Basis***.
Also,
 - For any vector space $V$, any spanning set of $V$ contains a ***Basis.***
In particular,
 - ***Any Vector Space has a Basis.***

Here the Basis of the Vector Space are actually the unit vectors or the basis vectors

Now,
Suppose $B = \{v_{1}\dots v_{n}\}$ is a basis.
Then, any $v \in V$ can be **uniquely** written in the form $v = a_{1}v_{1}+ \dots a_{n}v_{n}$
We fix the order $v_{1},\dots ,v_{n}$ on the basis $B$.

We define a function $\phi_{B}: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$  by 
$$
\phi_{B}(v) = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
As any such expression for $v$ is unique, $\phi_{B}$ is well-defined.
It is easy to see that $\phi_{B}$ is a ***Linear Transformation***

###### $\phi_{B}$ is a 1-1 function

If,
$$
\phi_{B}(v) = \phi_{B}(w) = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Then,  $v = a_{1}v_{1}+\dots a_{n}v_{n}=w$

###### $\phi_{B}$ is an onto function

Let, 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n}
\end{pmatrix} 
\in
\mathbb{R}^{n}
$$
Let $v = a_{1}v_{1}+\dots + a_{n}v_{n}$
Then,
$$
\phi_{B}(v) = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Thus, an ***ordered basis***  ( $i.e,$ a basis with a given order).
$B = (v_{1}, \dots v_{n})$ defines a linear transformation $\phi_{B} : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ 
$\phi_{B}$ is 1-1 and onto
$\phi_{B}^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow V$  is given by
$$
\phi_{B}^{-1}\left(\begin{pmatrix}
a_{1} \\
\vdots \\
a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}\right) = a_{1}v_{1}+ \dots + a_{n}v_{n}
$$
