## Linear Independence

A set $S \subset V$ is said to be ***Linearly Independent*** if for any $v \in S$ , we have ,  $\color{#d693f5}v \notin Span(S \setminus \{v\})$

This means that no element can be written as a linear combination of other elements.
No element can be thrown out without altering the span.


### Characterization of Linear Independence

 Let $V$ be a vector space
 Let $S \subset V$ . Then,
 1. $S$ is linearly Independent
 2. Any element of $Span(S)$ can be uniquely written in the form $\sum_{v \in S}a_{v} \cdot v$
 3. If $\sum_{v \in S}a_{v} \cdot v = \bar{0}$  ,  then we must have $a_{v} = 0 \:\: \forall \:\: v$  
    There is no collection of real numbers $\{a_{v}\}_{v \in S}$ such that at least one of them is non-zero and $\sum a_{v}\cdot v =0$

#### Proof that 1. implies 3.

We assume $S$ is linearly independent.
Suppose $\sum_{v \in S} a_{v} \cdot v =0$  for some choice of real numbers $a_{v}$.
We want to prove that $a_{v}= 0$ for all $v$
Suppose, for some $v_{o} \in S$  ,  $a_{v_{o}} \neq 0$
Then,
	$a_{v_{o}} \cdot v + \sum_{v \neq v_{o}} a_{v} \cdot v = 0$
So,
	$v_{o} = \sum _{v \neq v_{o}}\left( \frac{-a_{v}}{a_{v_{o}}} \right) \cdot v$
Thus,
	$v_{o} \in Span(S \setminus \{v_{o}\})$        $-$ **contradiction**
Thus,
	$a_{v}=0 \:\: \forall \:\: v \in S$

#### Proof that 3. implies 1.
We assume $3.$ is true.
Suppose $S$ is not linearly independent
Thus, for some $v \in S$ , we have $v \in Span(S \setminus \{v\})$ .
So,
	$v = \sum_{w \neq v}a_{w} \cdot w$
So,
	$-v + \sum_{w \neq v}a_{w}\cdot w = \bar{0}$
In this expression, the coefficient of $v$ is $-1$ , which is non-zero
This **contradicts** our assumption that $3.$ is true
Thus $S$ must be linearly independent.


#### Proof of 3. implies 2.

Assume $3.$ is true.
If $2.$ is not true, some $v \in Span(S)$ has two distinct expressions.
$$
v = \sum_{v \in S}a_{w} \cdot w \quad \text{and} \quad v = \sum_{w \in S} b_{w} \cdot w
$$
So,
	$\bar{0} = \sum_{w \in S}(a_{w}-b_{w}) \cdot w$
As the two expressions are distinct, there exists some $w_{o} \in S$ such that $a_{w_{o}} \neq b_{w_{o}}$
So,
	$a_{w_{o}}-b_{w_{o}} \neq 0$
As
	$\sum_{w \in S}(a_{w}-b_{w}) \cdot w = 0$  , this shows that $3.$ isn't true  $-$ **contradiction**


#### Proof that 2. implies 3.

Assume $3.$ is not true.
So, there exists an equality  $\sum_{w \in S}a_{w} \cdot w = \bar{0}$
where not all $a_{w}$ are equal to $0$
But, we also have $\sum_{w \in S} 0 \cdot w = \bar{0}$
	This violates $2.$ ( for $v = \bar{0}$ )      $-$ **contradiction**

So, we have proved
$1. \iff 2. \iff 3.$
Thus the conditions are equivalent

##### Note:
If all $a_{v}=0$ , then we say that it is a ***Trivial Linear Relation***.
If not then it is a ***Non-Trivial Linear Relation*** between the elements of $S$.

```ad-note
title: Linearly Dependent
A set is linearly independent if and only if there is no non-trivial linear relation between its element.

If a set is not linearly independent, we say that it is linearly dependent.

## Detecting Linear Dependence/Independence

In general we try to find a non-trivial solution to the equation
$$\sum_{w \in S} x_{w}\cdot w = 0$$
where $x_{w}$ are the variables
When $S$ is finite, say $S = \{v_{1}\dots v_{m}\}$ this means we have to find solutions to $x_{1}v_{1}+\dots x_{m}v_{m}=\bar{0}$

Suppose,
$S$
