# Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$


## Axioms of Natural Numbers 

- **N1.** $1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
- **N2.** If $n$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$, then its successor $n+1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
- **N3.** $1$ is not the successor of any element in $\mathbb{N}.$
- **N4.** If $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$ have the same successor, then $n=m$.
- **N5.** A subset of $\mathbb{N}$ which contains $1$, and which contains $n+1$ whenever it contains $n,$   must equal $\mathbb{N}.$
	   - $1 \in S$
	   - If $n \in S$ , then $n+1 \in S$
      and yet $S \neq \mathbb{N}$. 
      Consider the smallest member of the set $\{n \in \mathbb{N}\::\:n \notin S \}$ , call it $n_{0}$ .
      Since $1 \in S$ holds, it is clear $n_{0} \neq 1$ . So $n_{0}$ is a successor to some number in $\mathbb{N}$, namely $n_{0}-1$ .  (**N2**)
      We have $n_{0}-1 \in S$ since $n_{0}$ is the smallest member of $\{ n \in \mathbb{N}\::\: n\notin S \}$  .
      By the second property, the successor of $n_{0}-1$ , namely $n_{0}$ , is also in $S$ , which is a contradiction.

**N5** is the basis of Mathematical Induction
**N1** and **N5** are known as ***Peano Axioms***

## Mathematical Induction

Let $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \dots$  be a list of statements or propositions that may or may not be true. The principle of mathematical induction asserts all the statements $P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}\dots$  are true provided
- $P_{1}$ is true.  $-$ **called the Basis**
- $P_{n+1}$ is true whenever $P_{n}$ is true.

One of the well known derived results from Induction is the [[6.Cosets#Well Ordering Principle|Well Ordering Principle ]]

##### Example 1.1
Prove $1+2+3 + \dots + n = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1)$  for positive integers $n$ 

> Let, $P_{n}: 1+2+3 + \dots + n = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1)$ 
> Then, 
> 	$P_{1} : 1 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 1 \cdot(1+1)$  which is true.
> 	$P_{2} : 1 + 2 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 2 \cdot (2+1)$  which is also true.
> Thus we have satisfied both properties of Induction.
> Now, suppose $P_{n}$ is true. Let us calculate $P_{n+1}$ 
> $$
\begin{align}
1+2+\dots+n+(n+1) &= \frac{1}{2}n(n+1) + (n+1) \\ \\
&= \frac{1}{2}[n(n+1)+2(n+1)] \\ \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (n+1)(n+2) \\ \\
&=\frac{1}{2}(n+1)((n+1)+1)
\end{align}
$$
 Thus $P_{n+1}$ holds if $P_{n}$ holds. By Induction we conclude $P_{n}$ is true for all $n.$ 

```ad-note
title: Note
We did not prove "$P_{n+1}$ is true". We merely proved an implication. If $P_{n}$ is true, then $P_{n+1}$ is true. In a sense we proved an infinite number of assertions.
```

##### Example 1.2
Prove all numbers of the form $5^{n}-4n-1$ are divisible by $16.$

>$P_{n} : 5^{n}-4n-1$ is divisible by $16$
>The basis will be, 
>	$P_{1} : 5^{1}-4\cdot 1 - 1 = 0$   $-$ which is true.
>And,
>	$P_{2}:5^{2}-4\cdot 2 - 1 =16$  $-$ which is also true.
>
> Thus we can apply Induction
> Suppose $P_{n}$ is true. Thus we check $P_{n+1}$ 
> $5^{n+1} - 4(n+1) - 1 = 5(5^{n}-4n-1)+16n$ 
> Since $5^{n}-4n-1$ is a multiple of $16$.
> Then, $P_{n+1}$ is also a multiple of $16$.
> Hence we conclude a number of form $5^{n}-4n-1$ is divisible by 16
