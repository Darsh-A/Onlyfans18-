# Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$

**N1.** $1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
**N2.** If $n$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$, then its successor $n+1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
**N3.** $1$ is not the successor of any element in $\mathbb{N}.$
**N4.** If $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$ have the same successor, then $n=m$.
**N5.** A subset of $\mathbb{N}$ which contains $1$, and which contains $n+1$ whenever it contains $n$, must e
