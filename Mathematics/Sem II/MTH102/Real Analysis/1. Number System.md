# Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$

### Axioms of Natural Numbers 

- **N1.** $1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
- **N2.** If $n$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$, then its successor $n+1$ belongs to $\mathbb{N}$
- **N3.** $1$ is not the successor of any element in $\mathbb{N}.$
- **N4.** If $n$ and $m$ in $\mathbb{N}$ have the same successor, then $n=m$.
- **N5.** A subset of $\mathbb{N}$ which contains $1$, and which contains $n+1$ whenever it contains $n,$   must equal $\mathbb{N}.$
	   - $1 \in S$
	   - If $n \in S$ , then $n+1 \in S$
      and yet $S \neq \mathbb{N}$. 
      Consider the smallest member of the set $\{n \in \mathbb{N}\::\:n \notin S \}$ , call it $n_{0}$ .
      Since $1 \in S$ holds, it is clear $n_{0} \neq 1$ . So $n_{0}$ is a successor to some number in $\mathbb{N}$ , namely $n_{0}-1$ .
      We have $n_{0}-1 \in S$ since $n_{0}$ is the smallest member of $\{ n \in \mathbb{N}\::\: n\notin S \}$  .
      By the second property, the successor of $n_{0}-1$ , namely $n$

**N1** and **N5** are known as ***Peano Axioms***
