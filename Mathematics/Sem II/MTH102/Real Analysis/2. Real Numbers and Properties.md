# Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The Set $\mathbb{R}$ will include all rational numbers, all algebraic numbers, $\pi$ , $e$ and more..
We will define the set $\mathbb{R}$ entirely in terms of the set $\mathbb{Q}$ .
Meaning $\mathbb{R}$ will satisfy all properties [[1. Number System#Properties of Rational Numbers |A1 through A2, M1 through M2 and DL]] . 
The set $\mathbb{R}$ also has an order structure $\leq$ that satisfies properties [[1. Number System#Ordered Field |O1 through O5]] .
Thus, like $\mathbb{Q}$ , $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[1. Number System#Ordered Field|Ordered Field]] .

#### Theorem 2.1
The following are consequences of the field properties:

#### Definition 2.1 (Absolute Value)
$$
|a| = a \:\text{   if  } \:a \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\text{and} \:\:\:|a|=-a \:\: \text{if} \:\:a \leq 0
$$
Intuitively, the absolute value of a represents the distance between 0 and a, but in fact we will define the idea of “distance” in terms of the “absolute value,” which in turn was defined in terms of the ordering.

#### Triangle Inequality.
$$
|a+b| \leq |a|+|b| \:\:\:\text{for all} \:\:\: a,b
$$

## Completeness Axiom

Every nonempty subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound or $sup(A)$ $i.e,$ its real and exists

#### Supremum

Let $A$ be a nonempty set that is bounded above. We call a number $α$ _least upper bound_ or _supremum_ of $A$, if

1.  $x≤α$ for all $x \in A$ (that is, $α$ is an upper bound of $A$);
2.  If $M$ is an upper bound of $A$, then $α \leq M$ (this means $α$ is smallest among all upper bounds).

Hence we can write:
$\alpha = sup(A)$  $iff$
- $x \leq \alpha$ for all $x \in A$
- For any $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists  $\alpha \in A$ such that  $\alpha - \epsilon < a$  for some $a \in A$ 

#### Infimum

[ same as Supremum But ] : - $\beta + \epsilon > a$

### Corollary 2.1

Every nonempty subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound or $inf(A)$

## Archimedean Property

If $a > 0$  and  $b > 0$ , then for some positive integer $n$, we have $na>b$
