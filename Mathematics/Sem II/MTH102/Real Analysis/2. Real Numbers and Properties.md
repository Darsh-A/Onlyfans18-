# Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The Set $\mathbb{R}$ will include all rational numbers, all algebraic numbers, $\pi$ , $e$ and more..
We will define the set $\mathbb{R}$ entirely in terms of the set $\mathbb{Q}$ .
Meaning $\mathbb{R}$ will satisfy all properties [[1. Number System#Properties of Rational Numbers |A1 through A2, M1 through M2 and DL]] . 
The set $\mathbb{R}$ also has an order structure $\leq$ that satisfies properties [[1. Number System#Ordered Field |O1 through O5]] .
Thus, like $\mathbb{Q}$ , $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[1. Number System#Ordered Field|Ordered Field]] .

#### Theorem 1.1
The following are consequences of the field properties:
