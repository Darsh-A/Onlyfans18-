# Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$

The Set $\mathbb{R}$ will include all rational numbers, all algebraic numbers, $\pi$ , $e$ and more..
We will define the set $\mathbb{R}$ entirely in terms of the set $\mathbb{Q}$ .
Meaning $\mathbb{R}$ will satisfy all properties [[1. Number System#Properties of Rational Numbers |A1 through A2, M1 through M2 and DL]] . 
The set $\mathbb{R}$ also has an order structure $\leq$ that satisfies properties [[1. Number System#Ordered Field |O1 through O5]] .
Thus, like $\mathbb{Q}$ , $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[1. Number System#Ordered Field|Ordered Field]] .

#### Theorem 2.1
The following are consequences of the field properties:

#### Definition 2.1 (Absolute Value)
$$
|a| = a \:\text{   if  } \:a \geq 0 \:\:\:\:\text{and} \:\:\:|a|=-a \:\: \text{if} \:\:a \leq 0
$$
Intuitively, the absolute value of a represents the distance between 0 and a, but in fact we will define the idea of “distance” in terms of the “absolute value,” which in turn was defined in terms of the ordering.

#### Triangle Inequality.
$$
|a+b| \leq |a|+|b| \:\:\:\text{for all} \:\:\: a,b
$$

## Completeness Axiom

Let S be a nonempty subset of R. 
- If $S$ contains a largest element $s_{0}$ (that is, $s_{0}$ belongs to $S$ and $s ≤ s_{0}$ for all s ∈ S), then we call $s_{0}$ the maximum of $S$ and write $s_{0} = max S$. 
- If $S$ contains a smallest element, then we call the smallest element the minimum of $S$ and write it as $min S$.
