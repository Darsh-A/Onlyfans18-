## Consequences of Field Properties:

1. $a+c=b+c$   implies  $a=b$
   ***Proof:***
   $a + c = b + c$ implies $(a + c)+(−c)=(b + c)+(−c)$, so by $A1$, we have $a + [c + (−c)] = b + [c + (−c)]$. By $A4$, this reduces to $a +0= b + 0$, so $a = b$ by $A3$

2. $a · 0=0 \:\:\text{for all}\:\: a$
   We use $A3$ and $DL$ to obtain $a · 0 = a · (0 + 0) = a · 0 + a · 0$, so $0 + a · 0 = a · 0 + a · 0$. By $(i)$ we conclude $0 = a · 0$.

3. $(−a)b = −ab$ for all $a, b$

## Corollary 2.1 Proof

Proof Let −S be the set {−s : s ∈ S}; −S consists of the negatives of the numbers in S. Since S is bounded below there is an m in R such that m ≤ s for all s ∈ S. This implies −m ≥ −s for all s ∈ S, so −m ≥ u for all u in the set −S. Thus −S is bounded above by −m. The Completeness Axiom 4.4 applies to −S, so sup(−S) exists. Figure 4.1 suggests we prove inf S = − sup(−S). Let s0 = sup(−S); we need to prove − s0 ≤ s for all s ∈ S, (1) and if t ≤ s for all s ∈ S, then t ≤ −s0. (2) The inequality (1) will show −s0 is a lower bound for S, while (2) will show −s0 is the greatest lower bound, that is, −s0 = inf S. We leave the proofs of (1) and (2) to Exercise 4.9. It is useful to know: if a > 0, then 1 n < a for some positive integer n, (*) and if b > 0, then b 0 and b > 0 such that a < 1/n and n
