Let $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \dots$  be a list of statements or propositions that may or may not be true. The principle of mathematical induction asserts all the statements $P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}\dots$  are true provided
- $P_{1}$ is true.  $-$ **called the Basis**
- $P_{n+1}$ is true whenever $P_{n}$ is true.

#### [[1. Number System#Rational Zeros Theorem |Rational Zeros Theorem]]
Suppose $c_{0}, c_{1}, \dots ,c_{n}$ are integers and $r$ is a rational number satisfying the polynomial equation
$$c_{n}x^{n}+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+c_{1}x + c_{0} = 0$$
where $n \geq 1$ , $c_{n} \neq 0$  and $c_{0} \neq 0$ . Let $r = \frac{c}{d}$ where $c, d$ are integers having no common factors and $d \neq 0$ . Then $c$ divides $c_{0}$ and $d$ divides $c_{n}$ .

In other words, the only rational candidates for solutions of the above equation have the form $\frac{c}{d}$ where $c$ divides $c_{0}$ and $d$ divides $c_{n}$
