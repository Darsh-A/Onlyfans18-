Let $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, \dots$  be a list of statements or propositions that may or may not be true. The principle of mathematical induction asserts all the statements $P_{1},P_{2},P_{3}\dots$  are true provided
- $P_{1}$ is true.  $-$ **called the Basis**
- $P_{n+1}$ is true whenever $P_{n}$ is true.
