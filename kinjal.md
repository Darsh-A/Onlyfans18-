Objective 
To meet the growing demand of broilers, I intended to establish a broiler farm initially with broilers which will be reared on deep litter system/cages. All inputs require for rearing of birds are provided by contract farming company. After rearing all birds are marketed to the company on contract basis.

Location
The proposed unit will be located on a piece of land which is almost leveled & is well connected
