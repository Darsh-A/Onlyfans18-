Objective 
To meet the growing demand of broilers, I intended to establish a broiler farm initially with broilers which will be reared on deep litter system/cages. All inputs require for rearing of birds are provided by contract farming company. After rearing all birds are marketed to the company on contract basis.

Location
The proposed unit will be located on a piece of land which is almost leveled & is well connected to approach road. Electricity is available near the farm site. In the absence of assured of water supply, a tub well/hand pump is proposed on the farm. Underground water is adequately available & is of good quality

Housing
Provision has been made for the construction of a brooder-cum-grower house measuring at a rate of 1 sq feet in a case of broiler. Besides it, the farm will have a small store room, office & servants quarters. Construction of house will be pucka with absestos roofing. Provision has also been made for construction of built in laying nests. The installation of a tube well & laying of pipeline is also to be done.

Equipment
Standard equipment are available from various equipment manufacturers located in the nearby city.

Chicks
One day old commercial hybrid chicks are available from the hatcheries. In order to cover transportation, hatchery is supplying 3 percent extra chicks. Chicks will be vaccinated against Rd & Marek's at source. Chicks will be purchased in lots at regular intervals.

Feeds
Company will provides feeds require to birds on contract basis.

Medicine & Veterinary Aid
The person who will be looking after the day-to-day management of the farm is conversant with the use of medicines. In cases of need, the sick birds will be taken to the disease investigation laboratory located in town. For various operations like vaccination, debeaking etc. a poultry specialist visits the area at regular intervals.



CHAPTER 3
Market Potential

India is one of the fastest growing poultry feed markets in the world. Growing population, changes in food consumption habits, increasing consumptions of poultry products, etc. are some of the key reasons driving poultry feed markets in India. With the rise of middle class and increased urbanization, a major population prefers to go for non-vegetation.

1 billion+ population with per capita income increase of 5-6% annually make India a very large market. Most economical source of animal protein without any religious taboo. 80% of egg & poultry meat is targeting 30% urban India - vast untapped potential. With rapid urbanization, and increasing demand from the present 250 million economically strong, future is only bright for the poultry sector in India.

The domestic market has displayed increasing buoyancy, owing to a growing rural market based on lower feed and poultry prices in the sector. A growing rural market and awareness of new technologies and specialized methodologies and techniques also boosted market growth and reduced wastage. Among the meats analyzed in the region, poultry consumption is shown to be the most responsive to income and to have the strongest statistical relationship with income.


CHAPTER 4
Strengths

- Poultry has the potential to meet the protein requirements of a nation where malnutrition is rampant - since both eggs/broilers are a good source of protein
- Helps to augment the income of the rural masses. Thus improve the socio-economic status of rural population
- Poultry is one of the most efficient converters of plant products / waste into edible food that can in some measure tackle the problem of malnutrition especially in a country like India.
- Unlike other meat (beef, pork) which have religious taboos-chicken is widely accepted in India and is cheaper than goat meat.
- Poultry litter has high manure value and can be used in agriculture activities.
- It has tremendous potential to create non - farm employment and check migration from rural to urban areas.
- Generates relatively quick returns in low investment requirements

Opportunities
- Present per capita meat consumption in India is increasing day by day, therefore there is large scope for poultry farming.
- Besides this, India has also great potential to exploit the international market.
- The increasing awareness of the need for balanced nutrition has led to changes in the eating habits with vegetarians accepting eggs as a part of their diet compared to all other

Weakness
- Poultry farming is labor intensive.
- A peculiar feature of poultry industry is that it is highly fragmented.
- Poor transport, Infrastructure and lack of cold chain facilities currently limit the feasibility of handling significant volumes of chilled or frozen products.
- Low growing charges coupled with the cost of making investments in the infrastructure such as sheds, feeders, breeders, heating and cooling systems result in a low income for farmers.
- The stringent mortality norms (only 5% mortality is permitted in most integration contracts - else the farmer gets penalized and is offered a lower rate) leaves the farmers in a vulnerable position and with no avenue to voice their grievances.

Threats
- Natural calamities 
- If adequate health precautions are not taken infectious/contagious diseases can be spread. The recent avian flu has spread a wave of panic across the globe. The other aspects that have dragged the poultry industry are the recent SARS and Ebola and also the older diseases like tuberculosis and malaria
- Shortage in major feed ingredients ie, maize, which constitutes more than 50% of feed rations. Therefore, even a small increase in costs can wipe out the profits.
