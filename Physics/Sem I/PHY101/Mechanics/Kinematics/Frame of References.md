Frames of reference are systems of coordinates used to describe the position of a point or object in space. The most common frames of reference in physics are Cartesian, polar, cylindrical and spherical. 

The Cartesian frame of reference is the most commonly used frame of reference in physics, and is defined by the three axes of the x, y, and z directions. The position of a point in the Cartesian frame of reference is given by the following equation:

$\vec{r} = x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}+z\hat{k}$

The polar frame of reference is defined by two axes, the radial and angular axes. The position of a point in the polar frame of reference is given by the following equation:

$\vec{r} = r\hat{r} + \theta\hat{\theta}$

The cylindrical frame of reference is defined by three axes, the radial, angular, and axial axes. The position of a point in the cylindrical frame of reference is given by the following equation:

$\vec{r} = r\hat{r} + \theta\hat{\theta} + z\hat{k}$
