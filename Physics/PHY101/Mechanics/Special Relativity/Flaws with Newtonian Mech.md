***Newton's statement:***
> Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself and by its own true nature, flows uniformly on, without regard to anything external. Relative, apparent and common time is some sensible and external measure of absolute time estimated by the motions of bodies, whether accurate or inequable, and is commonly employed in place of true time; as an hour, a day, a month, a year.
