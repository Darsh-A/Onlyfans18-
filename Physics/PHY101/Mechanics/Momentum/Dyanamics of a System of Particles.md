## Momentum Through Internal and External Forces

Suppose all particles interact with the particles in the system and outside as well, Then,
$$
\begin{align}
f_{j} &= \frac{dp_{j}}{dt} \\ \\
f_{j} &= f_{j}^{int} + f_{j}^{ext} \\ \\
\sum_{j=1}^{N}f_{j}^{int} &+ \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j}^{ext} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{dp_{j}}{dt}

\end{align}
$$
We know by Newton's Third law i.e, The force between any two particles are equal and opposite so their sum is zero
Thus,
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_{j}^{int} = 0
$$
Hence,
$$
\begin{align}
P \equiv \sum_{j=1}^{N}p_{j} \\  \\
F_{ext} = \frac{dP}{dt}
\end{align}

$$

This shows how Internal and External Forces affect the momentum of the system

## Centre of Mass

$$
\begin{align}
F &= \frac{dP}{dt} \\ \\
F &= M\ddot{R} \\ \\
M\ddot{R} = \frac{dP}{dt} = \sum_{j=1}^{N}

\end{align}
$$
