Galilean transformations are a set of transformations that relate two coordinate systems moving relative to each other with constant relative velocity. These transformations are named after the Italian mathematician, physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei. They are used to transform the coordinates of a point from one coordinate system to another coordinate system that is moving with a constant velocity relative to the first. The Galilean transformations are used in classical mechanics and in special relativity. They are also used in quantum mechanics and in the theory of relativity.


The Galilean transformation is a mathematical transformation between two coordinate systems that moves with a constant velocity relative to each other. It is given by the following equation: 



where x, y, z are the coordinates of the original system, x', y', z' are the coordinates of the transformed system, v is the velocity of the transformation, and t is the time.
