In  [[Polar Coordinate System]] we have seen that acceleration has two non linear components.

$$
\require{physics}
\vectorarrow{a} = (\ddot{r}-r\dot{\theta}^{2})\hat{\mathbf{r}}+(r\ddot{\theta}+2\dot{r}\dot{\theta})\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}

## Centrifugal Force
Centrifugal force is an inertial force that appears to act on all objects when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. It is an outward force that appears to act on a body moving in a circular path. It is the force that appears to push the body away from the center of rotation.

The equation for centrifugal force is given by:

$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

where $F_c$ is the centrifugal force, $m$ is the mass of the object, $v$ is the velocity of the object, and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

## Coriolis Force
The Coriolis force is an inertial force that acts on objects that are in motion relative to a rotating reference frame. It is an apparent force that acts to the right of the direction of motion in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The Coriolis force is given by the following formula:

$$F_c = -2m\Omega \times v$$

Where $F_c$ is the Coriolis force, m is the mass of the object, $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the rotating reference frame, and v is the velocity of the object relative to the rotating reference frame.
