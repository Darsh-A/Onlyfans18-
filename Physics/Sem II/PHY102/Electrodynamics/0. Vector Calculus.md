## Differential Calculus
Suppose we have a function of one variable: $f(x)$. It is important to always remember what $df/dx$ represents.
It tells us how much the value of $f(x)$ will vary when we change the argument $x$ by a very small amount.

## Gradient
- Gradient is a vector operator. It should be treated very similar to a function but instead of acting on numbers, it acts on vectors.
- The gradient operator is represented by $\nabla$.
- Applying the gradient operator looks very similar to multiplication but it is *not multiplication*.
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla = \hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} 
$$

$\nabla$ behaves similar to vector despite being a vector operator. Therefore $\nabla$ can act in *3* ways:
1. On a scalar function $T$: $\nabla T$
2. On a vector function $v$, via dot product also called **Divergence**: $\nabla . v$
3. On a vector function $v$, via cross product also called **Curl**: $\nabla \times v$

### Scalar Operations
A scalar function $T$ is a multi-variate function: $f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\dots)$
Operating $\nabla$ on $T$ results in
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla T = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{1}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{2}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{3}} + \dots
$$

### Divergence {Dot Product}
We can construct the divergence from the definition of gradient.
$$
\require{physics}
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot v &= (\hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} ) . (v_{x} \hat{x} + v_{y} \hat{y} + v_{z} \hat{z}) \\
&= \frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_{z}}{\partial z} 
\end{align}
$$
The divergence of a vector field is a mathematical operation that describes the flow of the field out of a given point.

Geometrically, the divergence of a vector field at a point is a scalar that represents the rate at which the field is spreading out or converging at that point. If the divergence at a point is positive, then the field is spreading out from that point; if it is negative, then the field is converging towards that point; and if it is zero, then the field is neither spreading out nor converging at that point.

### Curl {Cross Product}
We can construct curl as the following
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla \cross v = \begin{bmatrix}



\end{bmatrix} 
$$
