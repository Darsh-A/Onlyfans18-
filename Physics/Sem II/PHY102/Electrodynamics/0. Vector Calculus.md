## Differential Calculus
Suppose we have a function of one variable: $f(x)$. It is important to always remember what $df/dx$ represents.
It tells us how much the value of $f(x)$ will vary when we change the argument $x$ by a very small amount.

## Gradient
- Gradient is a vector operator. It should be treated very similar to a function but instead of acting on numbers, it acts on vectors.
- The gradient operator is represented by $\nabla$.
- Applying the gradient operator looks very similar to multiplication but it is *not multiplication*.
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla = \hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} 
$$

$\nabla$ behaves similar to vector despite being a vector operator. Therefore $\nabla$ can act in *3* ways:
1. On a scalar function $T$: $\nabla T$
2. On a vector function $v$, via dot product also called **Divergence**: $\nabla . v$
3. On a vector function $v$, via cross product also called **Curl**: $\nabla \times v$

### Scalar Operations
A scalar function $T$ is a multi-variate function: $f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\dots)$
Operating $\nabla$ on $T$ results in
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla T = \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{1}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{2}} + \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_{3}} + \dots
$$

### Divergence {Dot Product}
We can construct the divergence from the definition of gradient.
$$
\require{physics}
\begin{align}
\nabla . v &= (\hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} ) . (v_{x} \hat{x} + v_{y} \hat{y} + v_{z} \hat{z}) \\
&= \frac{\partial v_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_{y}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_{z}}{\partial z} 
\end{align}
$$
The curl of a vector field is a mathematical operation that describes the rotation or circulation of the field at a given point.

Geometrically, the curl of a vector field at a point is a vector that is perpendicular to the surface that the vector field flows around that point. The magnitude of the curl vector represents the strength of the rotation or circulation, while the direction of the curl vector indicates the axis of rotation.

The curl of a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is given by the following formula:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \ F_x & F_y & F_z \end{vmatrix}
$$

where $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ are the unit vectors in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ are the partial derivative operators with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively.

Alternatively, we can express the curl of a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ in terms of its component functions as follows:

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z} \right) \mathbf{i} + \left( \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial x} \right) \mathbf{j} + \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) \mathbf{k}$$

This formula tells us that the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ has three components: one in the $x$ direction, one in the $y$ direction, and one in the $z$ direction. Each component is computed as the difference between two partial derivatives of the corresponding component of $\mathbf{F}$.

Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field itself
