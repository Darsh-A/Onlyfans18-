## Differential Calculus
Suppose we have a function of one variable: $f(x)$. It is important to always remember what $df/dx$ represents.
It tells us how much the value of $f(x)$ will vary when we change the argument $x$ by a very small amount.

## Gradient
- Gradient is a vector operator. It should be treated very similar to a function but instead of acting on numbers, it acts on vectors.
- The gradient operator is represented by $\nabla$.
- Applying the gradient operator looks very similar to multiplication but it is *not multiplication*.
$$
\require{physics}
\nabla = \hat{x} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \hat{y} \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \hat{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} 
$$

$\nabla$ behaves similar to vector despite being a vector operator.
