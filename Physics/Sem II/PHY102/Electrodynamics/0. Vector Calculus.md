## Differential Calculus
Suppose we have a function of one variable: $f(x)$. It is important to always remember what $df/dx$ represents.
It tells us how much the value of $f(x)$ will vary when we change the argument $x$ by a very small amount.

## Gradient
- Gradient is a vector operator. It should be treated very similar to a function but instead of acting on numbers, it acts on vectors.
- The gradient operator is represented by $\nabla$.
- Applying the gradient operator looks very similar to multiplication but it is *not multiplication*.
