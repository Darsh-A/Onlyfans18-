Crystal Field Theory (CFT) is a model that describes the splitting of energy levels of electrons in a transition metal ion in a solid-state environment due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding array of ligands (ions or molecules). CFT explains the colors, magnetic properties, and reactivity of transition metal complexes. The theory is based on the electrostatic interaction between the metal ion and the surrounding ligands, which cause the metal d-orbitals to split into two different energy levels. 

The energy splitting is represented by the following formula: 

$\Delta = \Omega_{CF} = \sum_{L}B_{L}\cdot \left \langle L \right \rangle$

Where $\Delta$ is the energy splitting, $\Omega_{CF}$ is the crystal field splitting energy, $B_{L}$ is the crystal field stabilization energy, and $\left \langle L \right \rangle$ is the ligand field strength.

## CFSE Calculation


Crystal Field Splitting Energy (CFSE) is the energy released when the d-orbitals of a transition metal ion split due to the electrostatic interactions between the metal ion and the surrounding ligands. It can be calculated using the following steps:
