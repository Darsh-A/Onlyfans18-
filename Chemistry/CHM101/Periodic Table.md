## Row-Wise Study of Elements 

### $1^{st}$ Row Elements
- Helium 
	- $1s$ orbital full, compact and low in energy 
- Hydrogen 
	- **More reactive:** $1s$ orbital higher in energy(as compared to $He$)
	- **Multicentered Bonding**(pair of electrons shared between more than $2$ centers)
	- **Chemical Versatility:** 
		- Contains one electron and loses it readily in aqueous media: property similar to *Alkali Metals*
		- Gains an electrons to gain noble gas conf. and readily forms hydrides: property similar to *Halogens*

### $2^{nd}$ Row Elements
- **Strong Multiple bonds:** the fraction of electron density involved in the $\pi$-overlap is significant for the more compact orbitals and shorter bonds
- **Resistance to high coordination no. centers:** smaller sizes of elements disfavour high coordination numbers 
 ![[row2 1.png]]


### $3^{rd}$ Row Elements 
- **Weak $\pi$ bonds**: little of the large and diffuse orbitals contribute to the overlap that stabilized the $\pi$ bond.
	More favourable to form multiple single bonds or cluster bonding

| -------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allotropes           | 1. $C$: sheet-like structures inolving multiple bonding(nanotubes,fullerenes) and $3D$ netwroks by single bonds | 1. $Si$ and $Ge$ only form 3D netwroks                                                                                                             |

| $nd$ orbitals        | Lack low-lying $nd$ orbitals, only $2s$ and $2p$ contribute to bonding                                          | Possess low-lying, unoccupied $nd$ orbitals: enable them to act as $\pi$ acid towards a ligand atom by forming dπ−pπ and dπ−dπ overlaps            |
| Coordination Numbers | Do not readily exhibit coordination numbers higher than $4$                                                     | Large size of these elements reduces steric strain that comes with addition of multiple ligands about a center- exhibits high coordination numbers |

## Diagonal Relationships 

![[diag.png]]

Some diagonally related elements have similar physical and chemical properties because:
- **Similar $\chi$ :** Increase in $\chi$ across a period is compensated by decrease in $\chi$ along a group 
- **Similar atomic sizes:** Atomic sizes decrease across a period and increase along a group

### $Li$ and $Mg$
- $Li$ : only alkali metal to form stable nitride $Li_{3}N$, oxide $Li_{2}O$ and $THF$ soluble alkyl carbonium salts like alkaline earth metals 
	Alkali metals usually form insoluble polymeric carbonium reagants, superoxides or peroxides, unstable nitrides and no oxides
![[Li and Be.png]]

### $Be$ and $Al$
- Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides 
- Form Carbide($C^{4-}$) salts instread of allylide($C_{3}^{4-}$) and acetylide($C_{2}^{2-}$)
![[be and al.png]]

### $B$ and $Si$
- Semiconductors
- Form acidic complex polymeric covalent oxides containing interlinking $EO_{4}$ tetrahedra 
	On the contrary, $C$ forms monomeric oxides and the oxides of higher cogeners of these elements are considered ionic. 
	$Ex: Al_{2}O_{3},Ga_{2}O_{3},In_{2}O,In_{2}O_{3},Tl_{2}O,GeO_{2},SnO_{2},PbO_{2},PbO$

- Form acidic halides($BCl_{3},SiCl_{4}$)
	- Halides of higher cogeners of $Si$ are ionic 
	- Binary halides of $C$ do not readily hydrolyze

## Group-Wise Study of Elements 

### Alkali Metals 
Cation formation favoured due to *low ionisation energies* and *high solvation energy*
![[IE.png]]
	Notice the significant decrease in solvation energy from $Li$ to $Na$

#### Chemical Properties 
1. **Effective Reducing Agents**
	- Reaction with water$$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ 2M(s) + 2H_{2}O \rightarrow 2M+ + 2OH- + H_{2}(g)} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (M=Li,Na,K,Rb,Cs) $$
		 $Na$ and$K$ give coloured flame and reactions of $Rb$ and $Cs$ are explosive 
	
	 - Reduction of alkyl halides by $Li$ metal to give organolithium reagents $$\require{mhchem}
    \ce{ R - Cl + 2Li(s) ->[THF] RLi + LiCl  }$$
	 - When metal cation is stabilized without oxidising reagant, it is possible to form salts of free or solvated electrons 
		 - $Na$ dissolved in dry donor solvents to give paramagnetic blue solutions $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ Na(s) + ->[NH_{3}] Na(NH_{3})+6 + e-(solv)} \ \ \ \ (at\:low\:Na+\:concentrations)$$
		 - At higher concentrations of sodium bronze solutions containing sodide(alkalide with sodium as anion) anions $M-$ are formed $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ 2Na(s) ->[NH_{3}] Na(NH_{3})+6 + Na-(solv)} \ \ \ \ (at\:high\:Na+\:concentrations )$$
		 - Electrides(ionic comp in which electron is anion) and Sodides: great reducing agents $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{Na(NH_{3})+6 + e- (solv) + Au(s) -> Na(NH_{3})+6 + Au- (solv)  }$$
		 - Electron decomposes by decomposing ammonia in presence of a catalyst $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ 2e- (solv) + 2NH_{3} ->[catalyst] 2NH_{2}- + H_{2} }$$
		 - Sodium-Ammonia solutions useful for preparing acetylides and reduced organometallic complexes $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ R - C#C -H + Na+ (solv) +e-(solv) -> R -C#C^{-}Na+ + \frac{1}{2}H_{2}}$$ $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ Fe(CO)5 + 2Na+ (solv) + 2e- (solv) -> (Na+)2[Fe(CO)5^{2-}] + \frac{1}{2}H_{2}}$$

2. **Tendency to form peroxides and superoxides**
	When burnt in excess of oxygen, 
	- $Li$ and $Na$ form $2:1$ salts of $O_{2}^{2-}$ 
	- $K,Rb$ and $Cs$ for a $1:1$ salts of $O^{2-}$ ![[superoxide_peroxide.png]]
	- Size effects are also responsible for alkali metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands: particularly crown ethers and cyptands ![[cryptands and crown ethers .png]]

### Group $13$ elements
#### Boron
Network covalent solid characterized by sharing of electrons in boron clusters, primarily linked *icosahedra*
![[icosahedra .png]]

##### Properties
>***Preparation***
- Reduction of its halides 
$$\require{mhchem}
\ce{ 2BCl_{3} + 3H_{2} -> 2B +6HCl}$$
- High temperature thermal decomposition of its hydrides 
$$
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ B_{2}H_{6} ->[\Delta] 2B + 3H_{2}}
$$

>***Bonding***
- Forms covalent bonds and engages in cluster and/or bridge bonding
- Boron posses $3$ electrons and can be stabilized by sharing $5$. This is done in following ways: 
1. Forms ordinary covalent bonds and gains extra electrons to give stable molecules or ions.
	 For example: 
		 - $BH_{3}$ can be stabilized by forming an adduct with a lewis base giving $BH_{4}^{-}$
		 - Borates and Boric acid derivatives and mixture of boraxes all of which are of the formula $[Na(H_{2}O)_{x}]_{2}H_{2}B_{4}O_{7}$ and contain tetraborate anion $B_{4}O_{5}(OH)_{4}^{2-}$  ![[borates_boroxes .png]]	 **Borates:**
			 - Boron is found in $BO_{4}$ tetrahedra and trigonal planar $BO_{3}$ units 
			 - Illustrate acid-base properties of boron compounds.$$\begin{align}
\require{mhchem} \\
\ce{ B_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O -> 2B(OH)3} \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> H+ + B(OH)2O- } \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> 3H+ + BO_{3}^{3-}}
\end{align}
$$
			- Since boron oxides can act as bronsted acids, borate ions are capable of acting as bronsted bases

2.  **Resonance**
	-  **Boron Trihalides**
		- $B-X$ bonds are shorter than those in analogous tetrahedral structures due to:
	        ($A$) *Resonance*
	        ($B$)Need to reduce strength of the greater number of reoulsions between the $F$ atoms in tetrahedral geometries than trigonal planar geometries 
	        ($C$)*Ligand Close Packing Model* (See structure $C$) ![[boron_trihalides.png]]
	-  **Borazines**
		- Similar to Benzene
			- Isoelectronic and isostructural to benzene.
			- Both are planar hexagonal molecular structures, non-planar and exist as relatively low boiling point liquids at room temp. 
			- The $B-N$ bond distance of $1.44\:\mathring A$ in Borazine being less than the $1.6\:\mathring A$ typical $B-N$ single bond distance and closer to $1.42\:\mathring A$ $C-C$ bond distance in benzene is a result of delocalised $\pi$ bonding in borazine. ![[borazine .png]]  
			- Electron density is more concentrated over the $N$ atoms as a result of $\chi$ differences between $N$ and $B$
				Because of this $B$ and $N$ atoms retain lewis acid and base character 
			  
			- *Polymorphs of Borazine*
			1. Layered Hexagonal Structure
				- In keeping the polarity of $B-N$ bonds, The $B$ atoms in one layer are arranged directly above $N$ atoms is the layer directly above or below 
				- Intersheet spacing of $3.3\:\mathring A$ does not allow interlayer bonding. 
				- Ability of sheets to move about relativly freely makes borazine a good lubricant(just like graphite). ![[layered_borazine .png]]
			2. Cubic $h-BN$ symmetries
				- $B$ and $N$ atoms tetrahedrally coordinated analogous to cubic diamond and Lonsdaleite form of carbon 
				- Layers are arranged so as to be linked in the form of chair or boat conformation $B_{3}N_{3}$ rings ![[chair_boat_borazine.png]]
				($B$) Chair conformation 
				($C$) Boat conformation 

3. **Bridge Bonding**
$BH_{3}$ attains stable configuration by forming $2c-3e^{-}$ bridge bonds 
![[bridge_bonding .png]]

4. **Cluster Bonding**
Boron shares electrons amongst multiple borons and other atoms in a cluster.  
Common among Boron hydrides and their derivatives 
![[Pasted image 20230114143641.png]]


- Higher boranes are formed by pyrolytic removal of $H_{2},H^{-}$, and/or $H^{+}$ units from$BH_{3}$ or $BH_{4}^{-}$ 
	It can be conceptualized as giving rise to $BH,BH^{-}$ and $BH_{2}$ units which come together to form clusters.

## Hydrides 

![[Pasted image 20230108040605.png]]

### Ionic Hydrides 
Metal salts of hydride ions
	- form *ionic lattices*
		$NaCl$ structure common for $MH$ and $PbI_{2}$ for $MH_{2}$ 
	- formed by all alkali metals and alkaline earth metals except $Be$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{2M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH(s)}\ \ \ \ (M=Li,Na,K,Rb)$$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH_{2} } \ \ \ \ (M=Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba)$$
	- Act as *reducing agents* towards metal oxides $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ 2CaH_{2}(s) + TiO_{2}(l) -> 2Cao(s) + Ti(s) + 2H_{2}}$$
	- Act as *strong bases* towards protic $E -H$ bonds(exothermic reaction with water, liberating $H_{2}$)$$\require{mhchem} \ce{ MH +H_{2}O -> M+ (aq) + H_{2}(g) + OH- }$$Therefore, $CaH_{2}$ can be used as drying agent for organic solvents
	- To *deprotonate reactive $C - H$ bonds*$$\require{mhchem} \ce{ NaH(s) + CH_{3}C#C-H(g) -> CH_{3}C#C- Na+ + H_{2}(g) }$$

### Covalent and Intermediate Hydrides 
These are formed by non-metals, metalloids and many post-transition metals 
Properties vary depending on whether the element hydride is electron deficient, rich or electron precise. 

#### Electron-deficient Hydrides 
- Formed by $Be$, group $13$ elements 
	Neutral monomeric element hydrides do($BeH_{2},BH_{3}, AlH_{3},GaH_{3},etc.$) not have enough electrons to satisfy octet rule

- Dimerise or polymerise using bridging $E -H-E$ bonds which are $3c-2e^{-}$ bonds. 

#### Electron-precise Hydrides 
- Formed by group-$14$ elements 
	Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes of carbon and $SiH_{4},GeH_{4},SnH_{4},PbH_{4}$ 
- Do not possess any lone pairs 

#### Electron-rich Hydrides 
- Fomed by $N,O,F$ 
	$NH_{3},H_{2}O,HF$ and their heavier congeners form $PH_{3},H_{2}S,HCl$ 


#### Note: 
- In general, stability of element hydrides decreases down the group 
- Ability of an element hydride to function as an acid or hydride donor may be modified by factors like *Solvation Energy*. 
	For Example: $GeH_{4}$ is expected to be a hydride donor but it deprotonates in liquid ammonia due to high solvation energy of $H+$ ion


### Interstitial/Metallic Hydrides
- Hydrogen dissolves in metals to form non-stoichiometric compounds of the formula $MH_{n}$
- $H$ occupies interstices in a $FCC, HCP$ or $BCC$ metal lattice 
- Metal lattice expands by $10-20$% during the process
