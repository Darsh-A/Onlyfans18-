## Row-Wise Study of Elements 

### $1^{st}$ Row Elements
- Helium 
	- $1s$ orbital full, compact and low in energy 
- Hydrogen 
	- **More reactive:** $1s$ orbital higher in energy(as comapred to $He$)
	- **Multicentered Bonding**(pair of electrons shared between more than $2$ centers)
	- **Chemical Versatility:** 
		- Contains one electron and loses it readily in aqueous media: property similar to *Alkali Metals*
		- Gains an electrons to gain noble gas conf. and readily forms hydrides: property similar to *Halogens*

### $2^{nd}$ Row Elements
- **Strong Multiple bonds:** the fraction of electron density involved in the $\pi$-overlap is significant for the more compact orbitals and shorter bonds
- **Resistance to high coordination no. centers:** smaller sizes of elements disfavour high coordination numbers

### $3^{rd}$ Row Elements 
- **Weak $\pi$ bonds**: little of the large and diffuse orbitals contribute to the overlap that stabilized the $\pi$ bond.
	More favourable to form multiple single bonds or cluster bonding


| Property             | Row2                                                                                                            | Row3                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allotropes           | 1. $C$: sheet-like structures inolving multiple bonding(nanotubes,fullerenes) and $3D$ netwroks by single bonds | 1. $Si$ and $Ge$ only form 3D netwroks                                                                                                             |
|                      | 2.$N$ and $O$ form diatomic gases held by multiple bonds                                                        | 2. Clusters (P), layers (As, Sb), or chains (S, Se, Te ) held together by single covalent                                                          |
| $nd$ orbitals        | Lack low-lying $nd$ orbitals, only $2s$ and $2p$ contribute to bonding                                          | Possess low-lying, unoccupied $nd$ orbitals: enable them to act as $\pi$ acid towards a ligand atom by forming dπ−pπ and dπ−dπ overlaps            |
| Coordination Numbers | Do not readily exhibit coordination numbers higher than $4$                                                     | Large size of these elements reduces steric strain that comes with addition of multiple ligands about a center- exhibits high coordination numbers |

## Diagonal Relationships 

![[diag.png]]

Some diagonally related elements have similar physical and chemical properties because:
- **Similar $\chi$ :** Increase in $\chi$ across a period is compensated by decrease in $\chi$ along a group 
- **Similar atomic sizes:** Atomic sizes decrease across a period and increase along a group

### $Li$ and $Mg$
- $Li$ : only alkali metal to form stable nitride $Li_{3}N$, oxide $Li_{2}O$ and $THF$ soluble alkyl carbonium salts like alkaline earth metals 
	Alkali metals usually form insoluble polymeric caronium reagants, superoxides or peroxides, unstable nitrides and no oxides
![[Li and Be.png]]

### $Be$ and $Al$
- Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides 
- Form Carbide($C^{4-}$) salts instread of allylide($C_{3}^{4-}$) and acetylide($C_{2}^{2-}$)
![[be and al.png]]

### $B$ and $Si$
- Semiconductors
- Form acidic complex polymeric covalent oxides containing interlinking $EO_{4}$ tetrahedra 
	On the contrary, $C$ forms monomeric oxides and the oxides of higher cogeners of these elements are considered ionic. 
	$Ex: Al_{2}O_{3},Ga_{2}O_{3},In_{2}O,In_{2}O_{3},Tl_{2}O,GeO_{2},SnO_{2},PbO_{2},PbO$
- Form acidic halides($BCl_{3},SiCl_{4}$)
	- Halides of higher cogeners of $Si$ are ionic 
	- Binary halides of $C$ do not readily hydrolyze

## Group-Wise Study of Elements 

### Alkali Metals 
Cation formation favoured due to *low ionisation energies* and *high solvation energy*
![[IE.png]]
	Notice the significant decrease in solvation energy from $Li$ to $Na$

#### Chemical Properties 
1. **Effective Reducing Agents**
	- Reaction with water$$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ 2M(s) + 2H_{2}O \rightarrow 2M+ + 2OH- + H_{2}(g)} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (M=Li,Na,K,Rb,Cs) $$
		 $Na$ and$K$ give coloured flame and reactions of $Rb$ and $Cs$ are explosive 
	
	 - Reduction of alkyl halides by $Li$ metal to give organolithium reagents $$\require{mhchem}
    \ce{ R - Cl + 2Li(s) ->[THF] RLi + LiCl  }$$
	 - When metal cation is stabilized without oxidising reagant, it is possible to form salts of free or solvated electrons 
		 - $Na$ dissolved in dry donor solvents to give paramagnetic blue solutions $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ Na(s) + ->[NH_{3}] Na(NH_{3})+6 + e-(solv)} \ \ \ \ (at\:low\:Na+\:concentrations)$$
		 - At higher concentrations of sodium bronze solutions containing sodide(alkalide with sodium as anion) anions $M-$ are formed $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ 2Na(s) ->[NH_{3}] Na(NH_{3})+6 + Na-(solv)} \ \ \ \ (at\:high\:Na+\:concentrations )$$
		 - Electrides(ionic comp in which electron is anion) and Sodides: great reducing agents $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{Na(NH_{3})+6 + e- (solv) + Au(s) -> Na(NH_{3})+6 + Au- (solv)  }$$
		 - Electron decomposes by decomposing ammonia in presence of a catalyst $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ 2e- (solv) + 2NH_{3} ->[catalyst] 2NH_{2}- + H_{2} }$$
		 - Sodium-Ammonia solutions useful for preparing acetylides and reduced organometallic complexes $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ R - C#C -H + Na+ (solv) +e-(solv) -> R -C#C^{-}Na+ + \frac{1}{2}H_{2}}$$ $$\require{mhchem}
		 \ce{ Fe(CO)5 + 2Na+ (solv) + 2e- (solv) -> (Na+)2[Fe(CO)5^{2-}] + \frac{1}{2}H_{2}}$$

2. **Tendency to form peroxides and superoxides**
	When burnt in excess of oxygen, 
	- $Li$ and $Na$ form $2:1$ salts of $O_{2}^{2-}$ 
	- $K,Rb$ and $Cs$ for a $1:1$ salts of $O^{2-}$ ![[superoxide_peroxide.png]]
	- Size effects are also responsible for alkali metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands: particularly crown ethers and cyptands ![[cryptands and crown ethers .png]]

### Hydrides 
![[Pasted image 20230108040605.png]]

#### Ionic Hydrides 
Metal salts of hydride ions
	- formed by all alkali metals and alkaline earth metals except $Be$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{2M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH(s)}\ \ \ \ (M=Li,Na,K,Rb)$$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH_{2} } \ \ \ \ (M=Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba)$$
