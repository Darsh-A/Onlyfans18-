The periodic table organizes the elements in a particular way. A great deal of information can be gathered about the element just from its position in the periodic table.

## Milestones in Development of Periodic Table

## Mendeleev's Periodic Table

###  Characteristics:

1. Systematic classification of the elements.
2. Correction of atomic weights:
	1. Atomic Weight of Be corrected.
	2. Atomic Weight of Indium corrected.
3. Prediction of missing elements: 
	1. eka silicon / Germanium 
	2. eka boron / Scandium
	3. eka aluminum / Gallium

### Defects

1. Reverse atomic weight in some cases
2. Triads in Group VIII
3. Subgroup elements lacking in similarities
4. Position of isotopes
5. Position of lanthanides and actinides
6. Position of hydrogen as it also has similarities with Gr VII B elements etc.

## Non Traditional Forms of Periodic Chart

a) The spiral form due to Baumgauer
b) The helical form due to Bilecki
c) The dumb-bell form due to Basset
