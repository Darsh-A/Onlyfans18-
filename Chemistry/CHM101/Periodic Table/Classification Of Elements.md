3. Transition Elements
4. Inner Transition Elements

## Goldschimdt's Classification

Goldschmidt classification was on the basis of chemical affinity.

1. Siderophiles:
	- Iron loving elements. 
	- Tend to be associated with iron. 
	- Triads of group VIII.
2. Chalcophiles:
	- Sulphide loving elements. 
	- They are soft acids according to [HSAB theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSAB_theory). 
	- They possess 18 elements in their outermost shells.
3. Lithophiles:
	- Stone loving elements.
	- These metal ions tend to be associated with oxides.
	- These ions are typically hard acids.
	- They posses 8 electrons in their outermost shells.
	- Alkali Metals, Alkaline Earth Metals and some early members of the transition metals.
4. Atmophiles:
	- Vapor loving elements.
	- Tend to remain in gaseous forms.
	- N, O, inert gases

*NOTE :*
- Cr is lithophilic in crust, but in oxygen deficient condition, it can act as an chalcophile.
- Fe is siderophilic in the core, but lithophilic in the crust.
