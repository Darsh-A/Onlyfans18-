## General Properties

#### Catenation
Ability of elemen to form long chains or ring structures by linking its atoms with one another through covalent bonds 
	- Catenation tendency decreases down the group 
		$C\gg Si \approx Ge \gg Sn\gg Pb$ 
		As atomic size increases, strenght of element-element bond decreases

## Carbon 

### Allotropes 

#### $\alpha$- and $\beta$- Graphite 
- $\alpha$ form of graphite is the most stable carbon allotrope 
	formed naturally through decomposition of carbonaceous materialin sediments but also made synthetically by vapourizing the $Si$ out of $SiC$

#### Graphene 
- $2D$ nanomaterial 

#### Diamond 
- On being subjected to intense heat and pressure, graphite converts to dimaond 
$\color{green}\text{Physical\:Properties}$
	- Extremely hard 
	- Poor Electrical Conductor 

$\color{green}\text{Chemical\:Properties}$
	- All carbons are tetrahedral and held by $\sigma$ bonds and connected in chair conformations 
	- The $1.544 \mathring A\:C-C$ bond length in diamond is longer than $1.415\mathring A\:C-C$ bond length in graphite ![](https://i.imgur.com/nc9jMXU.png)



#### Fullerenes

- Sixty-carbon European football shaped buckministerfullerene 
- Such moclecules can be found in soot, carbon black and related materials 
- Can be produced by electrolytic or laser ablation or pyrolysis

> Carbon Natotubes 
>- intermediate between fullerenes cages and flat graphene 
>- are relatively linear![](https://i.imgur.com/lmOl499.png)

#### High-carbon content amorphous materials 
- Not a single form or a pure allotrope but a family of high-carbon content material
>This includes amorphous carbon, carbon black, soot, pyrolyzed coal, coal and charcoal 

#### Graphyne
