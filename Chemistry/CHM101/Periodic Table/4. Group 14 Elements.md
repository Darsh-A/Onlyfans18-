## General Properties

#### Catenation
Ability of elemen to form long chains or ring structures by linking its atoms with one another through covalent bonds 
	- Catenation tendency decreases down the group 
		$C\gg Si \approx Ge \gg Sn\gg Pb$ 
		As atomic size increases, strenght of element-element bond decreases 

## Carbon 

### Allotropes 

#### $\alpha$- and $\beta$- Graphite 
- $\alpha$ form of graphite is the most stable carbon allotrope 
	formed naturally through decomposition of carbonaceous materialin sediments but also made synthetically by vapourizing the $Si$ out of $SiC$

#### Graphene 
- $2D$ nanomaterial 

#### Diamond 
- On being subjected to intense heat and pressure, graphite converts to dimaond 
- $\color{green} Physical\:Properties$
	-Extremely hard 
	-Poor Electrical Conductor 
- All carbons are tetrahedral and held by $\sigma$ bonds and connected in chair conformations
