## Hydrogen Halides 
- As larger halogens become invloved, the bonding pair is more distant from the nucleus. The attraction is lessened and the bond should be weaker.
>This effects the thermal stability of the hydrogen halides and they easily break into hydrogen and halogen 
>	$HF$ and $HCl$ are thermally very stable though
