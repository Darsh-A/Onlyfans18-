# Carbon

## Carbon Dioxide $(CO_{2})$

### Formation 
>Burning of organic matter in a plentiful source of air 

### Chemical Properties
>Acidic anhydride of carbonic acid 
>$$\require{mhchem}\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> H_{2}CO_{3} }$$
>- Carbonated beverages have high partial pressures of $CO_{2}$ to drive equilibrium to $H_{2}CO_{3}$ , when beverage is opened, the equilibrium shifts to produce $CO_{2}$ 


## Carbon Monoxide$(CO)$

### Formation 
> Formed when carbon is burnt in limited source of air 
> 	happens in cigarettes and badly tuned automobile vehicles
> 
> Can be produced by dehydration of formic acid with hot conc. $H_{2}SO_{4}$ 
> $$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ HCOOH(l) -> CO(g) + H_{2}O(l) }
$$


### Chemical Properties 
> Reducing agent and is used in production of a number of metals, like iron in blast furnaces 


### Water Gas
>Fuel containing $CO$ and $H_{2}$
>Steam is forced over red-hot carbon based fuel:
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ H_{2}O + C -> CO + H_{2} } \:\:\:\:(\Delta H= +131\:{{kJ} / {mol}})
$$


## Carbides 
- Compound composed of carbon and a less electronegative element, usually a metal or a metal oxide 
>Carbides can be classified by chemical bonding type: 
>
>**Salt-like or ionic carbides**
>	having discrete carbon anions of the form $C^{4-}$, sometimes called methanides
>	$\color{grey}\text{Example:}$
>	$$\require{mhchem}\ce{ Al_{4}C_{3}(s) + 12H_{2}O(g) -> 4Al(OH)3(s) + 3CH_{4}(g)}$$
>	- Methanide ions are very strong Bronsted bases 
>
>**Acetylides$(C_{2}^{2-})$**
>	React with water to produce ethyne and the corresponding hydroxide 
>	- $CaC_{2}$ is the most common saline carbide 
>
>**Covalent Compounds**
>	Two carbides that are considered completely covalent are formed with elemnets most similar to carbon in size and electronegativity $-$ $B$ and $Si$ 
>	![](https://i.imgur.com/o0FPM1o.png)
>
>**Interstitial Compounds**
>	- Extremely hard and extremely brittle 
>	- Formed by direct reaction of a $d$-block metal and carbon at temp above $2000\:^{\circ}C$

# Silicon 

- Second most abundant atom in earth's crust, making up about $27$% of the average rock
- Occurs widely in rocks as silicates (compounds containing the silicate ion $SiO_{3}^{2-}$)
- Pure silicon can be obtained by reduction of quartzite with high purity carbon in an electric arc furnace
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ SiO_{2}(s) + 2C(s) ->[\Delta] Si(s) + 2CO(g) } \:\:\:\:(\text{crude\:is exposed to}\:Cl_{2}(g))
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ SiCl_{4} + 2H_{2} -> Si(s) + 4HCl}\:\:\:\:(\text{purer form of element})
$$

## Silica$(SiO_{2})$ 
>$\color{grey}\text{Examples:}$ tridmyte, coesite, cristobalite and stishovite are all mineral forma of silica, stable at $\color{#00FF00}\text{high\:temperatures}$ and $\color{#00FF00}\text{pressures}$

### Occurrence 
>Occurs natural in quartz
>Sand is usually small fragments of quartz. The golden brown color is obtained due to iron oxide impurities 
>	**Quartz:**
>	- Hard crystalline mineral composed of silica 
>	- Silicate made of pure silica
>		continuous framework of $SiO_{4}$ silicon-oxygen tetrahedra , with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra giving an empirical formula of $SiO_{2}$  

### Physical Properties 
- Hard 
>It gets its strength from covalent bonding network structure 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/5ItjE3y.png)

- Rigid Network Solid 
- Insoluble in water 

### Chemical Properties 
- Can be viewed as various arrangements of tetrahedral oxoanions of silicon in which each $Si-O$ bond has considerable covalent character 

### Uses 
- Differences in internal structure of these highly regular network solids leads to wide array of materials ranging from gemstones to fibers 

### Silica Gel 
Amorphous and porous form of $SiO_{2}$

$ZnSiO_{4}$ used as a substitute for diamond in cosmetic jewellery 
$Ca_{2}Mg_{5}(Si_{4}O_{11})_{2}(OH)_{2}$ (Tremolite or asbestos) can withstand extreme heat however fibers cab lodge in lung tissue where fibrous scar tissue forms; leads to cancer


## Silicones 
- Sythetic materials that consist of $-O-Si-O-Si-$ bonds and the remaining $Si$ bond positions are occupied by oraganic groups _

### Formation 
Derived by hydrolysis of dimethyldichlorosilane 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ nSi(CH_{3})Cl_{2} + nH_{2}O -> [Si(CH_{3})2O]_{n} + 2nHCl}
$$
- Polymerisation produces linear chains capped with $Si-Cl$ or $Si-OH$ groups 


### Uses 
- Used to waterproof fabrics as the oxygen atoms attach to the fabric leaving out the hydrophobic alkyl part sticking out of fabric surface
- Has medical applications: antacids, artificial joints, pacemakers, catheters, tubing, gastric bags, drains and endoscopic windows 


## Silicates$(SiO_{4}^{4-})$
>$\color{grey}\text{Examples}:$ Quartz, feldspars, olivine, micas, thomsonite, jadeite and prehnite


### Orthosilicates 
> Consists of single $SiO_{4}^{4-}$ units, the cations are other metals
> $Ex:$ $Be$ and $Zn$ ions are tetrahedrally bonded to the oxygen of the silicates in Phenacite ($Be_{2}SiO_{4}$) and Willemite($Zn_{2}SiO_{4}$) or Olivine($(Fe / Mg)_{2}SiO_{4}$)

### Pyrosilicates 
>When two $SiO_{4}^{4-}$ units are linked together, they form the pyrosilicate group $Si_{2}O_{7}^{6-}$
>$Ex:$ Thortveitite($Sc_{2}Si_{2}O_{7}$) 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/dRCCiIs.png)



### Ring and Chain Silicates 
>When two oxygens of a $SiO_{4}^{4-}$ unit share with other $SiO_{4}^{4-}$ units to form a ring or an infinite chain 
>Stoichiometry: $(SiO_{3})_{n}^{2n-}$
>Benitoite $BaTi(SiO_{3})_{3}$ contains three silica rings, these are relaxed $6$-atom rings
