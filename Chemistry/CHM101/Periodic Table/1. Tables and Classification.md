The periodic table organizes the elements in a particular way. A great deal of information can be gathered about the element just from its position in the periodic table.

## Milestones in Development of Periodic Table

## Mendeleev's Periodic Table

###  Characteristics:

1. Systematic classification of the elements.
2. Correction of atomic weights:
	1. Atomic Weight of Be corrected.
	2. Atomic Weight of Indium corrected.
3. Prediction of missing elements: 
	1. eka silicon / Germanium 
	2. eka boron / Scandium
	3. eka aluminum / Gallium

### Defects

1. Reverse atomic weight in some cases
2. Triads in Group VIII
3. Subgroup elements lacking in similarities
4. Position of isotopes
5. Position of lanthanides and actinides
6. Position of hydrogen as it also has similarities with Gr VII B elements etc.

## Non Traditional Forms of Periodic Chart

a) The spiral form due to Baumgauer
b) The helical form due to Bilecki
c) The dumb-bell form due to Basset

## Bohr's Classification

1. Inert Gas
2. Representative or Normal Elements
3. Transition Elements
4. Inner Transition Elements

## Goldschimdt's Classification

Goldschmidt classification was on the basis of chemical affinity.

1. Siderophiles:
	- Iron loving elements. 
	- Tend to be associated with iron. 
	- Triads of group VIII.
2. Chalcophiles:
	- Sulphide loving elements. 
	- They are soft acids according to [HSAB theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSAB_theory). 
	- They possess 18 elements in their outermost shells.
3. Lithophiles:
	- Stone loving elements.
	- These metal ions tend to be associated with oxides.
	- These ions are typically hard acids.
	- They posses 8 electrons in their outermost shells.
	- Alkali Metals, Alkaline Earth Metals and some early members of the transition metals.
4. Atmophiles:
	- Vapor loving elements.
	- Tend to remain in gaseous forms.
	- N, O, inert gases

*NOTE :*
- Cr is lithophilic in crust, but in oxygen deficient condition, it can act as an chalcophile.
- Fe is siderophilic in the core, but lithophilic in the crust.
