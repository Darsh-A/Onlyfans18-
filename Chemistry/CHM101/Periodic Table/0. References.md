#### Solvation Energy
The energy of solvation is **the amount of energy associated with dissolving a solute in a solvent**. If it is a positive number, the dissolving process is endothermic; if it is negative, it's exothermic.

#### Acetylides
In organometallic chemistry, acetylide refers to chemical compounds with the chemical formulas MC≡CH and MC≡CM, where M is a metal. The term is used loosely and can refer to substituted acetylides having the general structure RC−CM.
