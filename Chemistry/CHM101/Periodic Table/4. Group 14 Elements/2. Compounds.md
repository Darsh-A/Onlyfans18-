## Carbon Dioxide $(CO_{2})$

### Formation 
>Burning of organic matter in a plentiful source of air 

### Chemical Properties
>Acidic anhydride of carbonic acid 
>$$\require{mhchem}\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> H_{2}CO_{3} }$$
>- Carbonated beverages have high partial pressures of $CO_{2}$ to drive equilibrium to $H_{2}CO_{3}$ , when beverage is opened, the equilibrium shifts to produce $CO_{2}$ 


## Carbon Monoxide$(CO)$

### Formation 
> Formed when carbon is burnt in limited source of air 
> 	happens in cigarettes and badly tuned automobile vehicles
