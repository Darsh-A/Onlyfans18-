# Carbon

## Carbon Dioxide $(CO_{2})$

### Formation 
>Burning of organic matter in a plentiful source of air 

### Chemical Properties
>Acidic anhydride of carbonic acid 
>$$\require{mhchem}\ce{ CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> H_{2}CO_{3} }$$
>- Carbonated beverages have high partial pressures of $CO_{2}$ to drive equilibrium to $H_{2}CO_{3}$ , when beverage is opened, the equilibrium shifts to produce $CO_{2}$ 


## Carbon Monoxide$(CO)$

### Formation 
> Formed when carbon is burnt in limited source of air 
> 	happens in cigarettes and badly tuned automobile vehicles
> 
> Can be produced by dehydration of formic acid with hot conc. $H_{2}SO_{4}$ 
> $$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ HCOOH(l) -> CO(g) + H_{2}O(l) }
$$


### Chemical Properties 
> Reducing agent and is used in production of a number of metals, like iron in blast furnaces 


### Water Gas
>Fuel containing $CO$ and $H_{2}$
>Steam is forced over red-hot carbon based fuel:
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ H_{2}O + C -> CO + H_{2} } \:\:\:\:(\Delta H= +131\:{{kJ} / {mol}})
$$


# Silicon 

- Second most abundant atom in earth's crust
- Occurs widely in rocks as silicates (compounds contaning the silicate ion $SiO_{3}^{2-}$)
- Pure silicon can be obtained by reduction of quartzite with high purity carbon in an electric arc furnace
$$

$$
