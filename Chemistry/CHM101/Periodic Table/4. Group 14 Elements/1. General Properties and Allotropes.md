## General Properties

#### Catenation
Ability of elemen to form long chains or ring structures by linking its atoms with one another through covalent bonds 
	- Catenation tendency decreases down the group 
		$C\gg Si \approx Ge \gg Sn\gg Pb$ 
		As atomic size increases, strenght of element-element bond decreases 


#### Inert pair effect exerts structural effects 
- Inert pair of electrons influence the structure of compounds in the $(n-2)^{+}$ oxidation state 
>Electron pairs that do this by altering the observed geometry of compounds are said to be stereochemically active inert pairs 

$\color{grey}\text{Example:}$ lone pairs of $Sn(\text{II})Cl_{2}$ 
	- Gas phase $Sn(\text{II})Cl_{2}$ exhibits $AX_{2}E$  VSEPR geometry 
	- In solid states, hydrates and salts, all exhibit $AX_{3}E$ geometries

## Carbon 

### Allotropes 

#### $\alpha$- and $\beta$- Graphite 
- $\alpha$ form of graphite is the most stable carbon allotrope 
	formed naturally through decomposition of carbonaceous materialin sediments but also made synthetically by vapourizing the $Si$ out of $SiC$

#### Graphene 
- $2D$ nanomaterial 

#### Diamond 
- On being subjected to intense heat and pressure, graphite converts to dimaond 
$\color{green}\text{Physical\:Properties}$
	- Extremely hard 
	- Poor Electrical Conductor 

$\color{green}\text{Chemical\:Properties}$
	- All carbons are tetrahedral and held by $\sigma$ bonds and connected in chair conformations 
	- The $1.544 \mathring A\:C-C$ bond length in diamond is longer than $1.415\mathring A\:C-C$ bond length in graphite ![](https://i.imgur.com/nc9jMXU.png)



#### Fullerenes

- Sixty-carbon European football shaped buckministerfullerene 
- Such moclecules can be found in soot, carbon black and related materials 
- Can be produced by electrolytic or laser ablation or pyrolysis

> Carbon Natotubes 
>- intermediate between fullerenes cages and flat graphene 
>- are relatively linear![](https://i.imgur.com/lmOl499.png)

#### High-carbon content amorphous materials 
- Not a single form or a pure allotrope but a family of high-carbon content material
>This includes amorphous carbon, carbon black, soot, pyrolyzed coal, coal and charcoal 

#### Graphyne 
- A possible future carbon allotrope 
- If it is possible construct a form of carbon which includes or is even primarily made of $\require{mhchem} \ce{ C#C }$ bonds 
>These are predicted to be theoretically stable but not observed in nature yet ![](https://i.imgur.com/ahP2GkZ.png)

## Germanium 

- Recovered from flue dust of industrial plants processing zinc ores(occurs as an impurity in zinc) 
- Mainly used in semiconductor industry 


## Tin 
- Not very strong 
- Resistant to corrosion so used in tin plating 
- Easily obtained from its ore(cassiterite($SnO_{2}$)) by reduction with carbon 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ SnO_{2}(s) + C(s) ->[1200\:^{\circ}C] Sn(l) + CO_{2}}
$$
- Used in alloys such as bronze

## Lead 
- Easily obtained from its ore(galena($PbS$)) and converted into its oxude and then reduced with coke
$$

\require{mhchem}
\ce{ 2PbS(s) + 3CO_{2} ->[\Delta] 2PbO(s) + 2SO_{2}(g)} 
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ PbO(s) + C(s) -> Pb(s) + CO(g)  }
$$
