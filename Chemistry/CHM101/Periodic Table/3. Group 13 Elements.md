# Boron
Network covalent solid characterized by sharing of electrons in boron clusters, primarily linked *icosahedra*
![[icosahedra .png]]
## Properties
### Preparation
- Reduction of its halides 
$$\require{mhchem}
\ce{ 2BCl_{3} + 3H_{2} -> 2B +6HCl}$$
- High temperature thermal decomposition of its hydrides 
$$
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ B_{2}H_{6} ->[\Delta] 2B + 3H_{2}}
$$

### Bonding
- Forms covalent bonds and engages in cluster and/or bridge bonding
- Boron posses $3$ electrons and can be stabilized by sharing $5$. This is done in following ways: 
1. Forms ordinary covalent bonds and gains extra electrons to give stable molecules or ions.
	 For example: 
		 - $BH_{3}$ can be stabilized by forming an adduct with a lewis base giving $BH_{4}^{-}$
		 - Borates and Boric acid derivatives and mixture of boraxes all of which are of the formula $[Na(H_{2}O)_{x}]_{2}H_{2}B_{4}O_{7}$ and contain tetraborate anion $B_{4}O_{5}(OH)_{4}^{2-}$  ![[borates_boroxes .png]]
		$\color{pink}Borates$
			 - Boron is found in $BO_{4}$ tetrahedra and trigonal planar $BO_{3}$ units 
			 - Illustrate acid-base properties of boron compounds.$$\begin{align}
\require{mhchem} \\
\ce{ B_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O -> 2B(OH)3} \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> H+ + B(OH)2O- } \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> 3H+ + BO_{3}^{3-}}
\end{align}
$$
			- Since boron oxides can act as bronsted acids, borate ions are capable of acting as bronsted bases

2.  $\color{green}Resonance$
	-  $\color{pink}Boron\:Trihalides$
		- $B-X$ bonds are shorter than those in analogous tetrahedral structures due to:
	        ($A$) *Resonance*
	        ($B$)Need to reduce strength of the greater number of reoulsions between the $F$ atoms in tetrahedral geometries than trigonal planar geometries 
	        ($C$)*Ligand Close Packing Model* (See structure $C$) ![[boron_trihalides.png]]
	-   $\color{pink}Borazines$
		- Similar to Benzene
			- Isoelectronic and isostructural to benzene.
			- Both are planar hexagonal molecular structures, non-planar and exist as relatively low boiling point liquids at room temp. 
			- The $B-N$ bond distance of $1.44\:\mathring A$ in Borazine being less than the $1.6\:\mathring A$ typical $B-N$ single bond distance and closer to $1.42\:\mathring A$ $C-C$ bond distance in benzene is a result of delocalised $\pi$ bonding in borazine. ![[borazine .png]]  
			- Electron density is more concentrated over the $N$ atoms as a result of $\chi$ differences between $N$ and $B$
				Because of this $B$ and $N$ atoms retain lewis acid and base character 
			  
			- *Polymorphs of Borazine*
			1. $\color{grey}Layered\:Hexagonal \:Structure$
				- In keeping the polarity of $B-N$ bonds, The $B$ atoms in one layer are arranged directly above $N$ atoms is the layer directly above or below 
				- Intersheet spacing of $3.3\:\mathring A$ does not allow interlayer bonding. 
				- Ability of sheets to move about relativly freely makes borazine a good lubricant(just like graphite). ![[layered_borazine .png]]
			2. $\color{grey}Cubic\:h-BN\:symmetries$
				- $B$ and $N$ atoms tetrahedrally coordinated analogous to cubic diamond and Lonsdaleite form of carbon 
				- Layers are arranged so as to be linked in the form of chair or boat conformation $B_{3}N_{3}$ rings ![[chair_boat_borazine.png]]
				($B$) Chair conformation 
				($C$) Boat conformation 

3. $\color{green}Bridge\:Bonding$
$BH_{3}$ attains stable configuration by forming $2c-3e^{-}$ bridge bonds 
![[bridge_bonding .png]]

4. $\color{green}Cluster\:Bonding$
Boron shares electrons amongst multiple borons and other atoms in a cluster.  
Common among Boron hydrides and their derivatives

- Higher boranes are formed by pyrolytic removal of $H_{2},H^{-}$, and/or $H^{+}$ units from$BH_{3}$ or $BH_{4}^{-}$ 
	It can be conceptualized as giving rise to $BH,BH^{-}$ and $BH_{2}$ units which come together to form clusters.
	Consider the structure of *closo-dodecarborante* $[B_{12}H_{12}]^{2-}$(Diameter similar to benzene ring) 
	![[Pasted image 20230114145020.png]]
	- First diborane is pyrolyzed to give arachno-decaborane$(B_{10}H_{14})$, in a process in which loss of $B-H$ and $B-H-B$ bonds is compensated by formation of cluster bonds in which multiple $B$ atoms share the bonding electrons. 
		Resulting arachno-decaborane has the icosahedral(polyhedron having $20$ faces) shape of dodecarborante![[Pasted image 20230114163358.png]]
	- Two missing vertices in the arachno-cluster are added by allowing the cluster to react with additional $BH_{3}$ units in form of $Et_{3}N-BH_{3}$ ![[Pasted image 20230114183539.png]]
	Following are some more carborane clusters: ![[Pasted image 20230114184029.png]]

# Aluminium 
## Corundum 
- Most stable form of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ 
- Consists of layers of edge-linked $AlO_{6}$ octahedra(in the horizontal) vertex-linked to adjacent layers(in the vertical)

- $Al$ forms covalently bonded oxyanions
Example: $Al_{6}O_{18}^{18-}$ 
>Contains $AlO_{4}$ tetrahedra covalently vertex-linked into an $Al_{6}O_{6}$ ring 
>Calcium salt of this anion is found in tricalcium aluminate$(Ca_{3}Al_{2}O_{6})$ cements (formed by mixing 3 equivalents of $CaO$ with one of $Al_{2}O_{3}$)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/rmop7zt.png)

- $Al$ forms network as a solid and exists as $E_{2}X_{6}$ dimer as liquid, as a mixture of dimers and monomers in gas phase(ultimately giveing the monomer only at high temperatures)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Yll79zG.png)

- Aluminium Trihalides are effective Lewis acids 
>So, the can be used as a catalyst in Freidel-Crafts alkylations and acylations ![](https://i.imgur.com/sAkGbIL.png)

# General Properties of Group $13$ elements

- Trialkyl group $13$ compounds exist as monomers and dimers 
>Monomer-dimer preference shifts towards monomer going down the group
>- $GaR_{3}$ and $InR_{3}$ species exist as monomers 
>- For $Al$, monomer and dimer are often in equilibrium for smaller alkyl groups, shifting to monomer with bulky alkyl groups
>![](https://i.imgur.com/nCFemFp.png)


- Trialkyl aluminium and trialkyl gallium compunds are effective lewis acids 


- Group $13$ metals have varying tendencies to form covalent bonds, they tend to act chemically as metals.  ![](https://i.imgur.com/vbs0JWz.png)


- Post transition group $13$ elements exhibit inert pair effect 
>Lower oxidation states are more preferable going down the group 
>- Stability of higher$(n^{+})$ oxidation states: $Al^{3+}>Ga^{3+}>In^{3+}>Tl^{3+}$ 
>- Stability of lower$(n-2)^{+}$ oxidation state: $Al^{+}<Ga^{+}<In^{+}<Tl^{+}$
>This is why most stable oxide and chloride of $Al$ is $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and $AlCl_{3}$ and that of $Tl$ are $TlO_{2}$ and $TlCl$
