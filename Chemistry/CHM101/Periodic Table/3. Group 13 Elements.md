#### Boron
Network covalent solid characterized by sharing of electrons in boron clusters, primarily linked *icosahedra*
![[icosahedra .png]]
##### Properties
>***Preparation***
- Reduction of its halides 
$$\require{mhchem}
\ce{ 2BCl_{3} + 3H_{2} -> 2B +6HCl}$$
- High temperature thermal decomposition of its hydrides 
$$
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ B_{2}H_{6} ->[\Delta] 2B + 3H_{2}}
$$

>***Bonding***
- Forms covalent bonds and engages in cluster and/or bridge bonding
- Boron posses $3$ electrons and can be stabilized by sharing $5$. This is done in following ways: 
1. Forms ordinary covalent bonds and gains extra electrons to give stable molecules or ions.
	 For example: 
		 - $BH_{3}$ can be stabilized by forming an adduct with a lewis base giving $BH_{4}^{-}$
		 - Borates and Boric acid derivatives and mixture of boraxes all of which are of the formula $[Na(H_{2}O)_{x}]_{2}H_{2}B_{4}O_{7}$ and contain tetraborate anion $B_{4}O_{5}(OH)_{4}^{2-}$  ![[borates_boroxes .png]]
		**Borates:**
			 - Boron is found in $BO_{4}$ tetrahedra and trigonal planar $BO_{3}$ units 
			 - Illustrate acid-base properties of boron compounds.$$\begin{align}
\require{mhchem} \\
\ce{ B_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O -> 2B(OH)3} \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> H+ + B(OH)2O- } \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> 3H+ + BO_{3}^{3-}}
\end{align}
$$
			- Since boron oxides can act as bronsted acids, borate ions are capable of acting as bronsted bases

2.  **Resonance**
	-  **Boron Trihalides**
		- $B-X$ bonds are shorter than those in analogous tetrahedral structures due to:
	        ($A$) *Resonance*
	        ($B$)Need to reduce strength of the greater number of reoulsions between the $F$ atoms in tetrahedral geometries than trigonal planar geometries 
	        ($C$)*Ligand Close Packing Model* (See structure $C$) ![[boron_trihalides.png]]
	-   **Borazines**
		- Similar to Benzene
			- Isoelectronic and isostructural to benzene.
			- Both are planar hexagonal molecular structures, non-planar and exist as relatively low boiling point liquids at room temp. 
			- The $B-N$ bond distance of $1.44\:\mathring A$ in Borazine being less than the $1.6\:\mathring A$ typical $B-N$ single bond distance and closer to $1.42\:\mathring A$ $C-C$ bond distance in benzene is a result of delocalised $\pi$ bonding in borazine. ![[borazine .png]]  
			- Electron density is more concentrated over the $N$ atoms as a result of $\chi$ differences between $N$ and $B$
				Because of this $B$ and $N$ atoms retain lewis acid and base character 
			  
			- *Polymorphs of Borazine*
			1. Layered Hexagonal Structure
				- In keeping the polarity of $B-N$ bonds, The $B$ atoms in one layer are arranged directly above $N$ atoms is the layer directly above or below 
				- Intersheet spacing of $3.3\:\mathring A$ does not allow interlayer bonding. 
				- Ability of sheets to move about relativly freely makes borazine a good lubricant(just like graphite). ![[layered_borazine .png]]
			2. Cubic $h-BN$ symmetries
				- $B$ and $N$ atoms tetrahedrally coordinated analogous to cubic diamond and Lonsdaleite form of carbon 
				- Layers are arranged so as to be linked in the form of chair or boat conformation $B_{3}N_{3}$ rings ![[chair_boat_borazine.png]]
				($B$) Chair conformation 
				($C$) Boat conformation 

3. **Bridge Bonding**
$BH_{3}$ attains stable configuration by forming $2c-3e^{-}$ bridge bonds

4. **Cluster Bonding**
Boron shares electrons amongst multiple borons and other atoms in a cluster.  
Common among Boron hydrides and their derivatives

- Higher boranes are formed by pyrolytic removal of $H_{2},H^{-}$, and/or $H^{+}$ units from$BH_{3}$ or $BH_{4}^{-}$ 
	It can be conceptualized as giving rise to $BH,BH^{-}$ and $BH_{2}$ units which come together to form clusters.
	Consider the structure of *closo-dodecarborante* $[B_{12}H_{12}]^{2-}$(Diameter similar to benzene ring)
