#### Boron
Network covalent solid characterized by sharing of electrons in boron clusters, primarily linked *icosahedra*

##### Properties
>***Preparation***
- Reduction of its halides 
$$\require{mhchem}
\ce{ 2BCl_{3} + 3H_{2} -> 2B +6HCl}$$
- High temperature thermal decomposition of its hydrides 
$$
\require{mhchem}
\ce{ B_{2}H_{6} ->[\Delta] 2B + 3H_{2}}
$$

>***Bonding***
- Forms covalent bonds and engages in cluster and/or bridge bonding
- Boron posses $3$ electrons and can be stabilized by sharing $5$. This is done in following ways: 
1. Forms ordinary covalent bonds and gains extra electrons to give stable molecules or ions.
	 For example: 
		 - $BH_{3}$ can be stabilized by forming an adduct with a lewis base giving $BH_{4}^{-}$
		 - Borates and Boric acid derivatives and mixture of boraxes all of which are of the formula $[Na(H_{2}O)_{x}]_{2}H_{2}B_{4}O_{7}$ and contain tetraborate anion $B_{4}O_{5}(OH)_{4}^{2-}$  ![[borates_boroxes .png]]
		**Borates:**
			 - Boron is found in $BO_{4}$ tetrahedra and trigonal planar $BO_{3}$ units 
			 - Illustrate acid-base properties of boron compounds.$$\begin{align}
\require{mhchem} \\
\ce{ B_{2}O_{3} + 3H_{2}O -> 2B(OH)3} \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> H+ + B(OH)2O- } \\
\ce{ B(OH)3 <=> 3H+ + BO_{3}^{3-}}
\end{align}
$$
			- Since boron oxides can act as bronsted acids, borate ions are capable of acting as bronsted bases

2.  **Resonance**
	-  **Boron Trihalides**
		- $B-X$ bonds are shorter than those in analogous tetrahedral structures due to:
	        ($A$) *Resonance*
	        ($B$)Need to reduce strength of the greater number of reoulsions between the $F$ atoms in tetrahedral geometries than trigonal planar geometries 
	        ($C$)*Ligand Close Packing Model* (See structure $C$) ![[boron_trihalides.png]]
