- Oxidarion state ranges from $-3$ to $+5$ 
- Metallic character increases down the group


## Nitrogen

- Rare in earth's crust bur principle component of atmosphere($76$% by mass)

### Chemical Properties 
- Very electronegative and only element of group $15$ that can form hydrides capable of hydrogen bonding 
- Expressed every whole number oxidation state from $-3$ to $+5$ and additonally some fractional oxidation states 
- $\require{mhchem}\ce{ N#N }$ triple bond strenght is $944\: kJ.mol^{-1}$ making it almost an inert gas 

### Uses 
- Medicines, fertilizers, explosives and plastics 
- Nitrogen gas used in formation of ammonia in Haber's process 


### Formation of $N_{2}$ gas 
- Small amounts can be prepared by thermal decomposition of sodium azide
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 2NaN_{3}(s) ->[\Delta] 2Na + 3N_{2}}
$$
>In car airbags, decomposition of $NaN_{3}$ is initiated by an electrical arc 

- $NH_{4}NO_{2}$ is potentially explosive as is $NH_{4}NO_{3}$ which is also a powerful oxidant and a component of dynamite 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ NH_{4}NO_{2}(aq) ->[\Delta] N_{2} + 2H_{2}O }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 2NH_{4}NO_{3}(s) ->[>570K] 2N_{2} + O_{2} + 4H_{2}O}
$$


## Phosphorus 
- Exhibits Allotropy 
>$12$ forms reported including both crystalline and amorphous 
> **Crystalline White Phosphorus**
> - Standard state of phosphorus but metastable 
> 	lower stability probablt originates in strain associated with the $60^{\circ}$ bond angles 
> 	$$\require{mhchem} \underset{\text{Black}} {\ce{ P }} \ce{ <-[\Delta_{f}H^{\circ}=-39.3\: kj.mol^{-1}] } \underset{\text{White}}{\ce{ \frac{1}{4}P_{4} }} \ce{ ->[\Delta_{f}H^{\circ}=-17.6\:kJ.mol^{-1}] } \underset{\text{Red}} {\ce{ P }}$$
> 	
> - Tetrahedral $P_{4}$ molecules in which $P-P$ distances are used to define $r_{\text{cov}}=110\:\text{pm}$ for a single bond
