- Oxidarion state ranges from $-3$ to $+5$ 
- Metallic character increases down the group


## Nitrogen

- Rare in earth's crust bur principle component of atmosphere($76$% by mass)

### Chemical Properties 
- Very electronegative and only element of group $15$ that can form hydrides capable of hydrogen bonding 
- Expressed every whole number oxidation state from $-3$ to $+5$ and additonally some fractional oxidation states 
- $\require{mhchem}\ce{ N#N }$ triple bond strenght is $944\: kJ.mol^{-1}$ making it almost an inert gas 

### Uses 
- Medicines, fertilizers, explosives and plastics 
- Nitrogen gas used in formation of ammonia in Haber's process 


### Formation of $N_{2}$ gas 
- Small amounts can be prepared by thermal decomposition of sodium azide
