## Hydrides 


### Ammonia 
Hydrogen is catalytically reacted with nitrogen(derived from process air) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia 
This is known as ammonia sythesis loop (Haber-Bosch Process)
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 3H_{2} + N_{2} -> 2NH_{3} }
$$

#### Sythesis of Ammonia
- **Frank-Caro Process**
	- Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro
	- Method developed between $1895$ and $1899$ 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaO + 3C <=> CaC_{2} + CO }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaC_{2} + N_{2} <=> CaCN_{2} + C }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaCN_{2} + 3H_{2}O <=> CaCO_{3} + 2NH_{3} }
$$
- By action of $H_{2}O$ on the nitrides of $Li$ or $Mg$ by heating $[NH_{4}]^{+}$ salts with base or by reducing a nitrate or nitrite in alkaline solution with $Zn$ or $Al$
