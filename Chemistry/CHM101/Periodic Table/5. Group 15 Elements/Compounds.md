## Hydrides 


### Ammonia 
Hydrogen is catalytically reacted with nitrogen(derived from process air) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia 
This is known as ammonia sythesis loop (Haber-Bosch Process)
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 3H_{2} + N_{2} -> 2NH_{3} }
$$

- Aqeous ammonia is called ammonium hydroxide 
#### Sythesis of Ammonia
- **Frank-Caro Process**
	- Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro
	- Method developed between $1895$ and $1899$ 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaO + 3C <=> CaC_{2} + CO }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaC_{2} + N_{2} <=> CaCN_{2} + C }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ CaCN_{2} + 3H_{2}O <=> CaCO_{3} + 2NH_{3} }
$$
- By action of $H_{2}O$ on the nitrides of $Li$ or $Mg$ by heating $[NH_{4}]^{+}$ salts with base or by reducing a nitrate or nitrite in alkaline solution with $Zn$ or $Al$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ Li_{3}N + 3H_{2}O -> NH_{3} + 3LiOH}
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 2NH_{4}Cl + Ca(OH)2 -> 2NH_{3} + CaCL_{2} + 2H_{2}O}
$$
$$
\require{mhchem} \ce{ [NO_{3}]- + 4Zn + 6H_{2}O + 7[OH]- -> NH_{3} + 4[Zn(OH)4]2- }
$$


### Phosphine 
#### Synthesis 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ Ca_{3}P_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> 2PH_{3} + 3Ca(OH)2 }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ [PH_{4}]I + KOH -> PH_{3} + KI + H_{2}O}
$$


### $E_{2}H_{4}\:\:\text{E=N, P, As}$

#### Hydrazine($N_{2}H_{4}$)
- Colourless liquid, miscible with water and with a range of organic solvents
- Corrosive and toxic, its vapours form explosive mixtures with air 
- MP: $275K$ and BP: $386K$

- Although $\Delta_{f}H^{\circ}(N_{2}H_{4},298K)=+50.6\:kJ.mol^{-1}$, $N_{2}H_{4}$ at ambient temperatures is kinetically stable wrt $N_{2}$ and $H_{2}$ 

##### Uses 
- Alkyl derivatives of hydrazine have been used as rocket fuels, $e.g.$ combined with $N_{2}O_{4}$ in the Apollo missions 
- Has uses in agricultural and plastic industries and in the removal of $O_{2}$ from industrial water boilers to minimize corrosion 
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ N_{2}H_{4} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O}
$$

##### Synthesis 
**Raschig reaction** 
>Involves partial oxidation of $NH_{3}$ 
>Glue of gelatine is added to inhibit side-reaction which otherwise consumes the $N_{2}H_{4}$ 
>Additive removes traces of metal ions that catalyse reaction 

$$
\require{mhchem} \ce{ NH_{3} + NaOCl -> NH_{2}Cl + NaOH }  \:\:\:\color{#ADD8E6}{(fast)}
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ NH_{3} + NH_{2}Cl + NaOH -> N_{2}H_{4} + NaCl + H_{2}O }\:\:\:\: \color{#ADD8E6}{(slow)}
$$$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ 2NH_{2}Cl + N_{2}H_{4} -> N_{2} + 2NH_{4}Cl}
$$
##### Chemical Properties 
- In aqueous solution, usually forms $[N_{2}H_{5}]^{+}$ (hydrazinium) salts, some salts of $[N_{2}H_{6}]^{2+}$ have been isolated $e.g.$ $[N_{2}H_{6}][SO_{4}]$ 

- $N_{2}H_{4}$ is a weaker base than $NH_{3}$ 

$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ N_{2}H_{4}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) <=> [N_{2}H_{5}]+(aq) + [OH]-(aq) \:\:\: K_{b}(1)=8.9X{10}^{-7} }
$$
$$
\require{mhchem}\ce{ [N_{2}H_6]+(aq) + H_{2}O(l) <=> [N_{2}H_{6}]^{2+}(aq) + [OH]-(aq)\:\:\: K_{b}(2)\approx 10^{-14}  }
$$
Both $N_{2}H_{4}$ and $[N_{2}H_{5}]^{+}$ are reducing agents
