## Row-Wise Study of Elements 

### $1^{st}$ Row Elements
- Helium 
	- $1s$ orbital full, compact and low in energy 
- Hydrogen 
	- **More reactive:** $1s$ orbital higher in energy(as compared to $He$)
	- **Multicentered Bonding**(pair of electrons shared between more than $2$ centers)
	- **Chemical Versatility:** 
		- Contains one electron and loses it readily in aqueous media: property similar to *Alkali Metals*
		- Gains an electrons to gain noble gas conf. and readily forms hydrides: property similar to *Halogens*

### $2^{nd}$ Row Elements
- **Strong Multiple bonds:** the fraction of electron density involved in the $\pi$-overlap is significant for the more compact orbitals and shorter bonds
- **Resistance to high coordination no. centers:** smaller sizes of elements disfavour high coordination numbers

### $3^{rd}$ Row Elements 
- **Weak $\pi$ bonds**: little of the large and diffuse orbitals contribute to the overlap that stabilized the $\pi$ bond.
	More favourable to form multiple single bonds or cluster bonding

| -------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allotropes           | 1. $C$: sheet-like structures inolving multiple bonding(nanotubes,fullerenes) and $3D$ netwroks by single bonds | 1. $Si$ and $Ge$ only form 3D netwroks                                                                                                             |
|                      | 2.$N$ and $O$ form diatomic gases held by multiple bonds                                                        | 2. Clusters (P), layers (As, Sb), or chains (S, Se, Te ) held together by single covalent                                                          |
| $nd$ orbitals        | Lack low-lying $nd$ orbitals, only $2s$ and $2p$ contribute to bonding                                          | Possess low-lying, unoccupied $nd$ orbitals: enable them to act as $\pi$ acid towards a ligand atom by forming dπ−pπ and dπ−dπ overlaps            |
| Coordination Numbers | Do not readily exhibit coordination numbers higher than $4$                                                     | Large size of these elements reduces steric strain that comes with addition of multiple ligands about a center- exhibits high coordination numbers |

## Diagonal Relationships 

![[diag.png]]

Some diagonally related elements have similar physical and chemical properties because:
- **Similar $\chi$ :** Increase in $\chi$ across a period is compensated by decrease in $\chi$ along a group 
- **Similar atomic sizes:** Atomic sizes decrease across a period and increase along a group

### $Li$ and $Mg$
- $Li$ : only alkali metal to form stable nitride $Li_{3}N$, oxide $Li_{2}O$ and $THF$ soluble alkyl carbonium salts like alkaline earth metals 
	Alkali metals usually form insoluble polymeric carbonium reagants, superoxides or peroxides, unstable nitrides and no oxides
![[Li and Be.png]]

### $Be$ and $Al$
- Amphoteric oxides and hydroxides 
- Form Carbide($C^{4-}$) salts instread of allylide($C_{3}^{4-}$) and acetylide($C_{2}^{2-}$)
![[be and al.png]]

### $B$ and $Si$
- Semiconductors
- Form acidic complex polymeric covalent oxides containing interlinking $EO_{4}$ tetrahedra 
	On the contrary, $C$ forms monomeric oxides and the oxides of higher cogeners of these elements are considered ionic. 
	$Ex: Al_{2}O_{3},Ga_{2}O_{3},In_{2}O,In_{2}O_{3},Tl_{2}O,GeO_{2},SnO_{2},PbO_{2},PbO$

- Form acidic halides($BCl_{3},SiCl_{4}$)
	- Halides of higher cogeners of $Si$ are ionic 
	- Binary halides of $C$ do not readily hydrolyze

## Hydrides 

![[Pasted image 20230108040605.png]]

### Ionic Hydrides 
Metal salts of hydride ions
	- form *ionic lattices*
		$NaCl$ structure common for $MH$ and $PbI_{2}$ for $MH_{2}$ 
	- formed by all alkali metals and alkaline earth metals except $Be$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{2M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH(s)}\ \ \ \ (M=Li,Na,K,Rb)$$ $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ M(s) + H_{2}(g) ->[\Delta] 2MH_{2} } \ \ \ \ (M=Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba)$$
	- Act as *reducing agents* towards metal oxides $$\require{mhchem}
	\ce{ 2CaH_{2}(s) + TiO_{2}(l) -> 2Cao(s) + Ti(s) + 2H_{2}}$$
	- Act as *strong bases* towards protic $E -H$ bonds(exothermic reaction with water, liberating $H_{2}$)$$\require{mhchem} \ce{ MH +H_{2}O -> M+ (aq) + H_{2}(g) + OH- }$$Therefore, $CaH_{2}$ can be used as drying agent for organic solvents
	- To *deprotonate reactive $C - H$ bonds*$$\require{mhchem} \ce{ NaH(s) + CH_{3}C#C-H(g) -> CH_{3}C#C- Na+ + H_{2}(g) }$$

### Covalent and Intermediate Hydrides 
These are formed by non-metals, metalloids and many post-transition metals 
Properties vary depending on whether the element hydride is electron deficient, rich or electron precise. 

#### Electron-deficient Hydrides 
- Formed by $Be$, group $13$ elements 
	Neutral monomeric element hydrides do($BeH_{2},BH_{3}, AlH_{3},GaH_{3},etc.$) not have enough electrons to satisfy octet rule

- Dimerise or polymerise using bridging $E -H-E$ bonds which are $3c-2e^{-}$ bonds. 

#### Electron-precise Hydrides 
- Formed by group-$14$ elements 
	Alkanes, alkenes and alkynes of carbon and $SiH_{4},GeH_{4},SnH_{4},PbH_{4}$ 
- Do not possess any lone pairs 

#### Electron-rich Hydrides 
- Fomed by $N,O,F$ 
	$NH_{3},H_{2}O,HF$ and their heavier congeners form $PH_{3},H_{2}S,HCl$ 


#### Note: 
- In general, stability of element hydrides decreases down the group 
- Ability of an element hydride to function as an acid or hydride donor may be modified by factors like *Solvation Energy*. 
	For Example: $GeH_{4}$ is expected to be a hydride donor but it deprotonates in liquid ammonia due to high solvation energy of $H+$ ion


### Interstitial/Metallic Hydrides
- Hydrogen dissolves in metals to form non-stoichiometric compounds of the formula $MH_{n}$
- $H$ occupies interstices in a $FCC, HCP$ or $BCC$ metal lattice 
- Metal lattice expands by $10-20$% during the process

### Group $13$ elements






![](http $Al$ forms network as a solid and exists as $E_{2}X_{6}$ dimer as liquid, as a mixture of dimers and monomers in gas phase(ultimately giveing the monomer only at high temperatures)
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Yll79zG.png)

- Aluminium Trihalides are effective Lewis acids 
>So, the can be used as a catalyst in Freidel-Crafts alkylations and acylations ![](https://i.imgur.com/sAkGbIL.png)


#### General Properties of Group $13$ elements 
- Trialkyl group $13$ compounds exist as monomers and dimers 
>Monomer-dimer preference shifts towards monomer going down the group
>- $GaR_{3}$ and $InR_{3}$ species exist as monomers 
>- For $Al$, monomer and dimer are often in equilibrium for smaller alkyl groups, shifting to monomer with bulky alkyl groups
>![](https://i.imgur.com/nCFemFp.png)

- Trialkyl aluminium and trialkyl gallium compunds are effective lewis acids 

- Group $13$ metals have varying tendencies to form covalent bonds, they tend to act chemically as metals. ![](https://i.imgur.com/vbs0JWz.png)

- Post transition group $13$ elements exhibit inert pair effect 
>Lower oxidation states are more preferable going down the group 
>- Stability of higher$(n^{+})$ oxidation states: $Al^{3+}>Ga^{3+}>In^{3+}>Tl^{3+}$ 
>- Stability of lower$(n-2)^{+}$ oxidation state: $Al^{+}<Ga^{+}<In^{+}<Tl^{+}$
>This is why most stable oxide and chloride of $Al$ is $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and $AlCl_{3}$ and that of $Tl$ are $TlO_{2}$ and $TlCl$
