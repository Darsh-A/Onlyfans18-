- Emission spectra of stoms consists of certain discrete frequencies which are called $\color{#E39FF6}\text{line spectra}$
- $\color{#ADD8E6}\text{Hydrogen}$ has the simplest atomic spectra

Johann Balmer showed that a plot between frequency of the lines and $\frac{1}{n^2}\:(n=3,4,5,\dots)$ is linear

Frequencies in the visible region can be desribed by the equation 

$$
\nu=8.2202\times{10}^{14}\left( 1-\frac{4}{n^2} \right)\:\text{Hz}\:\:\:\:\:\:n=3,4,5\dots 
$$

$\text{OR,}$
$$
\overline{\nu} = 109
$$
