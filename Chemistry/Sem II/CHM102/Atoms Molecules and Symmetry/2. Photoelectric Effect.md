## Photoelectric Effect explained by a quantum hypothesis 

### <font color='#D0312D'>Expected observations(Classical Physics)</font>

- Electromagnetic radiation is an electric field oscillating perpendicular to its direction of propagation and 
$$
I\propto A^{2}
$$
where, 
$I$= intensity of radiation 
$A=$ amplitude of electric field 
>According to this, as $I$ increases, $A$ of oscillating electrons also increases. 
>Therefore, electrons at the surface of the metal oscillate along with the field and oscillate more violently as $I$ increases and should break away from the surface.

### Experimental Observations 

- $\text{KE}$ of ejected electrons is independent of the $I$ of radiation 

- There exixts a threshold frequency $\nu_{\circ}$ , characteristic of the metallic surface below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of $I$

- Above $\nu_{\circ}$ , $\text{KE}$ varies linearly with $\nu$

#### Einstein's Explanation 

- He applied Planck's hypothesis ($\Delta E=h\nu$) to the emission and absorption mechanism of atomic electronic oscillators
>He also proposed that energy existed in form of packets called $\color{#E39FF6}\text{photons}$ 

- Using conservation of energy, it was shown that:
> $$
\text{KE}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=h\nu-\phi\:\:\:\:\:\ (1.6)
$$
>where, 
>$\phi=$ work function of the metal
>
>Minimun frequency that will overcome the work function is the threshold frequency
> $$
h\nu_{\circ}=\phi\:\:\:\:\:(1.7)
$$$$
\Rightarrow \text{KE}=h\nu-h\nu_{\circ}\:\:\:\:\:(1.8)
