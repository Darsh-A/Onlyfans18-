## Photoelectric Effect explained by a quantum hypothesis 

### Expected observations($\text{Classical Physics}$)

- Electromagnetic radiation is an electric field oscillating perpendicular to its direction of propagation and the intensity of radiation is proportional to the square of amplitude of the osciallting electric field
>According to this, as intensity increases, amplitude of oscillating electrons also increases. 
>Therefore, electrons at the surface of the metal oscillate along with the field and osci
