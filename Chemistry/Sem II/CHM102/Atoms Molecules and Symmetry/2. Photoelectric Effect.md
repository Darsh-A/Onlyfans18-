## Photoelectric Effect explained by a quantum hypothesis 

### Expected observations($\text{Classical Physics}$)

- Electromagnetic radiation is an electric field oscillating perpendicular to its direction of propagation and 
$$
I\propto A^{2}
$$
where, 
$I$= intensity of radiation 
$A=$ amplitude of electric field 
>According to this, as $I\uparrow$, $A$ of oscillating electrons also increases. 
>Therefore, electrons at the surface of the metal oscillate along with the field and oscillate more violently as $I$ increases and should break away from the surface. 


### Experimental Observations 

- $\text{KE}$ of ejected electrons is independent
