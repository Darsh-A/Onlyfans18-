## Photoelectric Effect explained by a quantum hypothesis 

### <font color='#D0312D'>Expected observations(Classical Physics)</font>

- Electromagnetic radiation is an electric field oscillating perpendicular to its direction of propagation and 
$$
I\propto A^{2}
$$
where, 
$I$= intensity of radiation 
$A=$ amplitude of electric field 
>According to this, as $I$ increases, $A$ of oscillating electrons also increases. 
>Therefore, electrons at the surface of the metal oscillate along with the field and oscillate more violently as $I$ increases and should break away from the surface.

### Experimental Observations 

- $\text{KE}$ of ejected electrons is independent of the $I$ of radiation 

- There exixts a threshold frequency $\nu_{\circ}$ , characteristic of the metallic surface below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of $I$

- Above $\nu_{\circ}$ , $\text{KE}$ varies linearly with $\nu$
