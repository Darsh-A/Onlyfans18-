## Photoelectric Effect explained by a quantum hypothesis 

### Expected observations($\text{Classical Physics}$)

- Electromagnetic radiation is an electric field oscillating perpendicular to its direction of propagation and 
$$
I\propto A^{2}
$$
where, 
$I$=
>According to this, as intensity increases, amplitude of oscillating electrons also increases. 
>Therefore, electrons at the surface of the metal oscillate along with the field and oscillate more violently as intensity increases and should break away from the surface.
