###### Blackbody 
Ideal body which emits and absorbs all frequencies and serves as ideal radiating material

Derived expression consistent with experimental curves of intensity v/s frequency : ***Rayleigh-Jeans Law***

$$
d\rho(\nu,T)=\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu=\frac{8\pi k_{B}T}{c^3}\nu^2d\nu
$$
where,
- $\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu$  $(J\cdot m^{-3})$ is the radiant energy density between $\nu$ and $\nu+d\nu$ 
- $T$ is absolute temperature 
- $k_{B}$ $(J\cdot K^{-1} \cdot \text{particle}^{-1})$ is the $\color{#ADD8E6}{Boltzmann\:Constant}$


### Ultraviolet Catastrophe 

**Rayleigh-Jeans Law** predicts that at high frequencies, radiant energy density diverges as $\nu^{2}$ $i.e.$ intensity of radiation emitted by an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium goes to infinity 
>This phenomenon could not be explained by $\color{#ADD8E6}\text{Classical Physics}$


## Quantum Hypothesis to derive Blackbody radiation Law 

- Planck assumed radiation emitted by blackbody is caused due to oscillations of electrons in constituent particles of the material body 
> These electrons were pictured as oscillating in an atom much like electrons oscillate in an antenna to give radio waves 
> However, oscillations occur at much higher frequencies in the $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{visible}$, $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{IR}$ and $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{UV}$ region

- Planck assumed that the
