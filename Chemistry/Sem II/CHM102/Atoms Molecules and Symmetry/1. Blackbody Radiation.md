###### Blackbody 
Ideal body which emits and absorbs all frequencies and serves as ideal radiating material

Derived expression consistent with experimental curves of intensity v/s frequency : ***Rayleigh-Jeans Law***

$$
d\rho(\nu,T)=\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu=\frac{8\pi k_{B}T}{c^3}\nu^2d\nu
$$
where,
- $\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu$  $(J\cdot m^{-3})$ is the radiant energy density between $\nu$ and $\nu+d\nu$ 
- $T$ is absolute temperature 
- $k_{B}$ $(J\cdot K^{-1} \cdot \text{particle}^{-1})$ is the $\color{#ADD8E6}{Boltzmann\:Constant}$


### Ultraviolet Catastrophe 

**Rayleigh-Jeans Law** predicts that at high frequencies, radiant energy density diverges as $\nu^{2}$ $i.e.$ intensity of radiation emitted by an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium goes to infinity 
>This phenomenon could not be explained by $\color{#ADD8E6}\text{Classical Physics}$


## Quantum Hypothesis to derive Blackbody radiation Law 

### Planck's assumptions 

- Radiation emitted by blackbody is caused due to oscillations of electrons in constituent particles of the material body 
> These electrons were pictured as oscillating in an atom much like electrons oscillate in an antenna to give radio waves 
> However, oscillations occur at much higher frequencies in the $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{visible}$, $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{IR}$ and $\color{#CBC3E3}\text{UV}$ region

- Energies of the oscillators were discrete and had to be proportional to an integral multiple of frequency$(\nu)$
> $$
E=nh\nu
$$
>Derived equation:  $\color{#FFCCCB}\text{Planck's Distribution Law for Blackbody Radiation}$  $$
d\rho(\nu,T)=\rho_{\nu}Td\nu=\frac{8\pi h}{c^{3}} \frac{\nu^{3}d\nu}{e^{h\nu/k_{B}T}-1}
$$
>**Problem with Rayleigh-Jeans Law:**
>They had assumed that the electronic oscillators responsible for emission can have any value whatsoever which is one of the basic assumptions of classical physics 


Planck's Distribution can also be expressed in terms of wavelenght :
$$
\begin{align}
\lambda \nu=c \\
d\nu=-c\frac{d\nu}{\nu^{2}}
\end{align}
$$
