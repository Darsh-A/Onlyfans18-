###### Blackbody 
Ideal body which emits and absorbs all frequencies and serves as ideal radiating material

Derived expression consistent with experimental curves of intensity v/s frequency : ***Rayleigh-Jeans Law***

$$
d\rho(\nu,T)=\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu=\frac{8\pi k_{B}T}{c^3}\nu^2d\nu
$$
where,
- $\rho_{\nu}(T)d\nu$  $(J\cdot m^{-3})$is the radiant energy density between $\nu$ and $\nu+d\nu$ 
- $T$ is absolute temperature 
- $k_{B}$ is the $\color{blue}{Boltzmann\:Constant}$
