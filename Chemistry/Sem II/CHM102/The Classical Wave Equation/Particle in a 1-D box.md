For particle confined in length $l$,


$$
\frac{\partial^2\Psi(x)}{\partial x^2}+k^2\Psi(x)=0
$$

where, 
$$
k^2=\frac{2mE}{\bar{h}^2}
$$
where, 
$m$ is the mass of the particle 
$E$ is the energy 
>$PE$ need not be taken into account as particle experiences no external force and undergoes no other interaction. 

and $\bar{h}=\frac{h}{2\pi}$
